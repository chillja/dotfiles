2015-01-22 11:37:38	Spaddlewit	Well then hopefully they will find refuge in the skin that turns Roly into a basketball
2015-01-22 11:37:41	Spaddlewit	Or a golfball
2015-01-22 11:38:44	IkeKrull	Spaddlewit: also, you should realise that the number of people who are actually seriously making games is quite low, and a large percentage of those people will already be committed to another engine.. the number of people actually starting up dev on a platformer at any given time is going to be fingers-on-one-hand numbers.. it will take time for your engine to gain a foothold
2015-01-22 11:39:22	Spaddlewit	I'm thankful that we have a few people already making content whatsoever, IkeKrull. Most of that is due to their loyalty from our past work
2015-01-22 11:39:35	Spaddlewit	Some of them even donated, which blew my mind
2015-01-22 11:40:37	Spaddlewit	I didn't write the post thinking that everyone would stop what they're doing and rush over to mod Roly, but I hoped that we'd at least find a few people who would enjoy the title enough to want to be a part of a greater community that could come together to produce content
2015-01-22 11:41:09	IkeKrull	have you posted it to /r/gaming? or jusr /r/gamedev?
2015-01-22 11:41:13	Spaddlewit	http://spaddlewit.com/forum/thread-39.html I don't even have a full level guide (a user is writing one up on his own accord atm) and someone managed to make this just by reverse-engineering our levels.
2015-01-22 11:41:21	Spaddlewit	Just /r/gamedev. Didn't think /r/gaming would be appropiate.
2015-01-22 11:41:45	Spaddlewit	Would just be advertising there, since what I wanted to give emphasis to were the extensibility/modding capabilities.

2015-01-22 11:45:07	IkeKrull	yeah.. best thing to do is just keep posting things over time e.g. 'this is what spriteset X that Y posted the other day looks like in the engine' - shiny screenshots help a lot to build interest because it requires zero effort, just clicking

2015-01-22 11:47:32	Spaddlewit	We have an ambient occlusion guide, level creation is just 3D modeling with a few tweaks in another program, and adding custom content is a console command

2015-02-19 22:12:35	deepwellstudios	It’s our first game as a studio, so it’s designed to be small and achievable.
2015-02-19 22:12:39	Xardov	oh okay
2015-02-19 22:12:53	Xardov	it's just that a game where you click one time and just wait doesn't really feel like a game at all
2015-02-19 22:12:59	deepwellstudios	Trust me, we want it to be more involved too. But we’re just getting started, so I’m not terribly concerned about it.
2015-02-19 22:13:00	Xardov	to me, at least
2015-02-19 22:13:05	+k-hos	I am pretty sure batman likes bats
2015-02-19 22:13:21	deepwellstudios	That’s true. We’re hoping to make the one click really, really important.
2015-02-19 22:13:36	deepwellstudios	Would adding a scoreboard to compare yourself to peers help with that feeling of being more involved?
2015-02-19 22:13:47	deepwellstudios	Super suspenseful click.
2015-02-19 22:13:52	deepwellstudios	Life or death click.

2015-02-19 22:45:00	IssacRedfield	Well, I have Spanish Developers in the studio.
2015-02-19 22:45:25	IssacRedfield	It doesn’t make any sense to alienate their friends and family from playing and testing the game because we didn’t localize it to Spanish.
2015-02-19 22:45:49	IssacRedfield	And the game is so small, with only a little bit of text and some emails to translate, it hopefully shouldn’t be too hard.
2015-02-19 22:45:54	IssacRedfield	But I want it to be high quality.
2015-02-19 22:45:58	IssacRedfield	So that’s going to be hard.

2015-04-08 02:30:11	+irinix	Leandros, with a tab, you always know what you're going to get.  Although the "Tab -> Space" equivelant might be different on different systems, your formatting is preserved by the tab character
2015-04-08 02:30:13	+Shammah	not sure why the fuck you'd want to use it though
2015-04-08 02:30:17	Leandros	> Upon closer examination of the data, a trend emerges: Developers increasingly prefer spaces as they gain experience. Stack Overflow reputation correlates with a preference for spaces, too: users who have 10,000 rep or more prefer spaces to tabs at a ratio of 3 to 1.

2015-04-08 04:45:47	thehiddenrain	how is that related to people not returning after the first session

2015-04-08 04:45:54	thehiddenrain	yer
2015-04-08 04:46:14	thehiddenrain	its obviously because the player doesnt think the game is worth playing lol\

2015-04-08 06:12:57	KdotJPG	what "caves" are in minecraft. So yes, tunnels
2015-04-08 06:13:04	+Axord	Looks neat KdotJPG.
2015-04-08 06:13:08	+prohobo_imo	thats what they look like in minecraft?
2015-04-08 06:13:28	KdotJPG	somewhat
2015-04-08 06:13:52	KdotJPG	they are tunnels that snake through (because they're generated using some automata that picks points and moves them along randomly)
2015-04-08 06:15:21	KdotJPG	Also yeah, the (d/dx)^2+(d/dy)^2 is just the magnitude of the derivative in the X/Y directions, so that is a density function in and of itself
2015-04-08 06:16:19	KdotJPG	I actually think there are two separate networks, one where d/dz > 0 and one where d/dz < 0 -- but I haven't checked that yet
2015-04-08 06:16:27	theweirdn8	well here is video of my game engine editor made in SDL. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RE6KyH6lclo&feature=youtu.be
2015-04-08 06:16:33	KdotJPG	in other words, color one red and color the other green, and they don't touch

2015-04-08 06:19:30	Leandros	speed up?
2015-04-08 06:19:38	Leandros	just record with 30 / 60 FPS
2015-04-08 06:19:45	theweirdn8	cam studio does a bad job at recording
2015-04-08 06:20:05	Leandros	than use one of the millions of other applications for desktop recording ...

2015-04-08 07:03:19	GodEmperorFrigo	isn't it a rare case though when you only need 1 component for a system and can iterate through them easily?

2015-04-08 07:04:07	+Lemtzas	Jeffool: do you mean the 10% thing or the "perceived value pricing" ?
2015-04-08 07:04:09	Jeffool	I know, it's crazy. Someone saw something you said on the Internet!
2015-04-08 07:04:18	Jeffool	Perceived value pricing, I don't think I'd do, as a client.
2015-04-08 07:04:45	+Lemtzas	Seems about the same as the usual system, tbh
2015-04-08 07:05:04	+Lemtzas	Only instead of the developer bidding the highest amount they think they can get away with, the client bids the lowest amount they think they can get away with
2015-04-08 07:05:21	Jeffool	Because while I might be aware of how valuable something is to me, that gives me little/no insight as to the work involved by a professional to create it. And I'll only ever know if I'm undervaluing it and the artist turns me down. Otherwise, I'm giving free money away.
2015-04-08 07:05:45	+Lemtzas	from the other side it's like getting less money than you're worth, though
2015-04-08 07:05:54	+Lemtzas	or rather "less money than you could have gotten"
2015-04-08 07:06:02	GodEmperorFrigo	void_: I am thinking of two main approaches here
2015-04-08 07:06:07	+Lemtzas	which seems to be primarily a concern among people who are already established
2015-04-08 07:06:20	GodEmperorFrigo	one is to store arrays of components in an Entity
2015-04-08 07:06:30	GodEmperorFrigo	Component[number of component types] components;
2015-04-08 07:06:47	GodEmperorFrigo	and you could access it via components[Position.ID]

2015-04-08 07:06:55	Jeffool	Yeah, I get it. But if I were the project lead, what if I give away too much on one project, leaving another with too small a budget because I misjudged the work involved? So something I deemed unimportant becomes costly?
2015-04-08 07:07:11	Jeffool	So, maybe as a batch, I could see it working.
2015-04-08 07:07:15	GodEmperorFrigo	the other is to store Components in ComponentMaps
2015-04-08 07:07:27	GodEmperorFrigo	that are basically maps
2015-04-08 07:07:42	GodEmperorFrigo	Map<entity id int or long, Component> components;
2015-04-08 07:07:43	+Lemtzas	If you deemed it unimportant presumably you would be offering less?

2015-04-08 07:28:56	Jeffool	No, I don't think he's wrong. I think we're seeing a quickly expanding creator market, but it's still not "huge" yet. As it grows, his technique could become far more valid. But if it's effectively the same as traditional negotiation... Why bother?
2015-04-08 07:29:57	+Lemtzas	well on the flip side I'm not really sure what /my/ work is worth beyond some minimum value (But a client surely knows what it's worth to them if they're actually looking to pay)
2015-04-08 07:30:05	+Lemtzas	so flipping the tables is useful
2015-04-08 07:30:45	Jeffool	Y'know I think that's the clutch. I'd have to really want a particular person's work to engage in this. If the work has to be done to spec, then I want it on my terms to get it cheap for me.
2015-04-08 07:31:44	+Lemtzas	Can you clarify "If the work has to be done to spec" ?
2015-04-08 07:32:23	+Lemtzas	I know what it would mean in software dev terms but it seems like you're speaking from a different perspective
2015-04-08 07:33:12	Jeffool	If the work was creative in nature, and left room to interpretation, and I was a fan of someone's work, then sure. But if I knew exactly I wanted, and it was quantifiable, then I might less likely to engage.
2015-04-08 07:33:15	Jeffool	I may well be.
2015-04-08 07:33:48	+Lemtzas	It seems like from a creative perspective this practice wouldn't really make sense
2015-04-08 07:33:49	Jeffool	Like I said earlier, I'm thinking in TV terms, as that's my wheelhouse. Set design, art assets, those are stylistic. Set production (from a design) is to specification.
2015-04-08 07:34:47	+Lemtzas	In the case of something like "I need a website that does X" I think it makes a good amount of sense to have the client provide a quote
2015-04-08 07:34:58	+Lemtzas	or for technical work like "I need an app that does X"
2015-04-08 07:35:20	Jeffool	In software, I think it would be more like "if I needed a tool created, I know what it does, what it would have access to. I want the layout like this. etc." There may be creativity in problem solving in building it, but that doesn't impact the user or tool itself so much.
2015-04-08 07:35:41	Jeffool	So, for that? No, no estimating on my behalf. You give me a number, I'll determine if it's worth it.
2015-04-08 07:36:08	Jeffool	heh, so we're on opposite sides.

2015-04-08 19:47:06	Madsy	The normal projection matrix used in computer graphics is basically a pinhole camera. It projects 3d scene down to a flat plane

2015-04-08 19:47:27	esas	yeah that makes sense

2015-04-08 19:47:58	Madsy	And the FOV in such a perspective matrix just scales x and y. The plane is still perfectly flat (no bend)
2015-04-08 19:49:00	Madsy	As x in tan(x*0.5) nears 90 degrees, the image becomes really distorted, because the limit of tan(x) as x goes to 90 is infinity

2015-04-08 21:25:17	+CloudPop	I support gender roles in the sense that in nature it's a stuctured system of survival, and it's what "we" did to get where we are, and although we're progressing beyond it, I respect the roles for their place and time. I do not support forced gender roles, because anyone can do anything, etc.
2015-04-08 21:26:15	+CloudPop	So, I am all for doing what you want, no one should be shoe-horned.
2015-04-08 21:26:25	+sreich	i'd rather be penised
2015-04-08 21:26:26	+CloudPop	But that doesn't mean that gender roles are a full-on bad thing.
2015-04-08 21:26:28	+sreich	not shoe-horned
2015-04-08 21:26:45	+CloudPop	It's just how people deal with the idea of gender roles that becomes a problem.

2015-04-08 21:28:29	+sreich	it is masochism in a really literal sense

2015-04-27 13:26:23	Tannz0rz_	I'll give you the exact paper I derived the algorithm from

2015-04-27 23:49:35	cvl4317	that's why the option of donation comes in, no? not enough donations, modders quiut
2015-04-27 23:49:42	+MrBushido	yeah
2015-04-27 23:49:53	+MrBushido	donations
2015-04-27 23:49:54	Giik-	modders aren't always in it for the money anyway
2015-04-27 23:49:56	cvl4317	because i thought one of the things in conflict is no-donation allowed
2015-04-27 23:50:11	+MrBushido	Giik-: sure, and not all mods are worth paying for
2015-04-27 23:50:19	cvl4317	either completely free , or paid 25% from sold price
2015-04-27 23:50:32	cvl4317	nothing in between
2015-04-27 23:50:36	+MrBushido	but that's a little beside the point, some people were quite obviously interested in getting retursn for their hard work
2015-04-27 23:50:41	+MrBushido	and you can gtfo with donations
2015-04-27 23:50:44	cvl4317	donations tend to be that small little sweet spot
2015-04-27 23:51:07	+MrBushido	what you get from donations vs a paid product is comparable to releasing a game that isn't on steam
2015-04-27 23:51:13	+MrBushido	to one that is
2015-04-27 23:51:19	cvl4317	i can understand that some people want their mods to be like DLC , a product
2015-04-27 23:51:42	cvl4317	they want to sell their product , get money from it, it is one thing
2015-04-27 23:51:54	cvl4317	but then, only 25% goes to them? that is quite sad
2015-04-27 23:52:10	cvl4317	and why the heck bethesda got cut from it?
2015-04-27 23:52:13	+MrBushido	well
2015-04-27 23:52:32	+MrBushido	bethesda cant let mods be sold without taking a cut
2015-04-27 23:52:35	cvl4317	pyaing full games for skyrim is not good enough?
2015-04-27 23:52:47	+MrBushido	because if they had some kind of agreement somebody would abuse that logic and release a full game
2015-04-27 23:53:12	cvl4317	ehm... how?
2015-04-27 23:53:42	cvl4317	i mean, try to give me a stretched scenario
2015-04-27 23:53:44	+MrBushido	and steam deserves a cut because it's the difference between having a fuckton of people seeing your mod is for sale and perhaps having the right link with your donation link several pages in to a google search for "good skyrim mods"
2015-04-27 23:54:01	cvl4317	deserve a cut is a thing
2015-04-27 23:54:14	+MrBushido	bethesda changes modding license to not be "we own this shit you cannot sell it" to "its yours do what you like and charge if you want"
2015-04-27 23:54:16	+MrBushido	then i take it
2015-04-27 23:54:23	cvl4317	now i am curious what is typical valve service fee cut for normal games
2015-04-27 23:54:23	+MrBushido	and remake a completely stand alone game
2015-04-27 23:54:35	+MrBushido	and dont have to spend millions developing my own engine
2015-04-27 23:55:01	cvl4317	i can see that logic
2015-04-27 23:55:14	cvl4317	effectively make skyrim a license-less game engine
2015-04-27 23:55:43	+MrBushido	also any success that a commercial skyrim mod has is because of the years of effort, money and marketing that have been put in to it
2015-04-27 23:55:58	+MrBushido	if you write a star wars novel you probably wouldn't get 25% of the profits
2015-04-27 23:56:10	cvl4317	i can see that stretch
2015-04-27 23:56:27	+MrBushido	so yeah, 25% is kind of low
2015-04-27 23:56:52	+MrBushido	but its better than the effective nothing that modders can get now
2015-04-27 23:57:26	cvl4317	the change in nature of modding ... is the issue
2015-04-27 23:57:31	+MrBushido	nobody is going to be making mods professionally for skyrim based on donations. not while living comfortably at least

2015-04-28 06:28:43	ScioMin	humm, let's go.

2015-04-28 06:29:41	ScioMin	(maybe because they didn't properly format the machine before handing to me)

2015-04-28 06:31:47	Leandros	and complete freezes were indeed somewhat common for a time
2015-04-28 06:32:18	ScioMin	yeah, I guess it's because the devops guys did all sorts of strange configurations in that network. Windows and OSX machines had problems with that network.
2015-04-28 06:32:21	Leandros	but mostly fixed in a few weeks through updates
2015-04-28 06:32:33	Leandros	stupid guy i guess
2015-04-28 06:32:42	ScioMin	another problem was RAM. 8gb was far from enough for my needs, I was scratching swap more often than I wanted.
2015-04-28 06:32:58	Leandros	I, honestly, had a lot more issues with networking on linux
2015-04-28 06:33:08	Leandros	well, I have 16gb and this isn't enough either
2015-04-28 06:33:11	ScioMin	at that time we didn't had docker/vagrant so VMs were heavy
2015-04-28 06:33:35	Leandros	heh

2015-04-28 10:02:03	Jeffool	My idea? $60 for a season, and at least five hours of game-story each month, in addition to furthering interactivity with the gameworld significantly each month. But I don't know Batman well enough to know if it could be done. But Spider-Man? Sure.
2015-04-28 10:02:22	+CloudPop	It depends on how much they left in the core game.
2015-04-28 10:02:29	+CloudPop	Origins was pretty light for 60 bucks.

2015-04-28 12:10:57	+k-hos	the items in all 3 games are great too

2015-04-28 12:11:10	+k-hos	fire rod, magnetic gloves, rocs feather
2015-04-28 12:11:11	Giik|Mobile	they came out after OoT too, so you get some callbacks to it
2015-04-28 12:11:20	+k-hos	rocs feather is my favorite item
2015-04-28 12:11:23	+CloudPop	People HATED Wind Waker when it came out, but now it's one of the best.
2015-04-28 12:11:31	+k-hos	nothing beats becoming a pogostick

2015-04-28 12:18:26	Giik|Mobile	even if you get a game over then it just restarts instead of doing plot stuff and splitting the timelines

2015-04-28 12:19:21	+CloudPop	Speaking of which, the latest MK Storyline is actually really good.

2015-04-28 12:40:21	Jeffool	But thanks, vraid.
2015-04-28 12:40:29	+MrBushido	i think it will have similar issues to the 2d style 3ds game
2015-04-28 12:41:12	Jeffool	What were they? I never played it, but it looked neat.
2015-04-28 12:41:25	+MrBushido	just a little too easy because there was no real exploration puzzles
2015-04-28 12:41:45	+MrBushido	since in the 2d 3ds zelda game you could do the dungeosn in any order
2015-04-28 12:41:57	Jeffool	Ah. Huh.
2015-04-28 12:42:43	+MrBushido	perhaps lennas inception will have some clever generation code to make such item requirement puzzles in a way that makes a completable game

2015-05-10 21:56:20	NerdTaco	even though they released the source code 10+ years ago
2015-05-10 21:56:29	Xardov	that's because your average person doesn't know how to compile source code
2015-05-10 21:56:34	+tm512	they released the source code in 1997
2015-05-10 21:56:45	NerdTaco	tm512, so like 17 years ago

2015-05-10 21:58:01	Xardov	tm512: I don't want people to take my game as their own

2015-05-13 23:51:58	MrBushido	irinix: have you written a single threaded game yet?
2015-05-13 23:52:05	+irinix	MrBushido, yes.

2015-05-13 23:53:02	+irinix	that version is buggy but playable
2015-05-13 23:54:32	+tm512	I don't understand how, in Java, people like to dedicate entire folders to just a single file/folder, heh
2015-05-13 23:55:28	grim001	sometimes only one class belongs in a package
2015-05-13 23:55:36	MrBushido	its easier to have a single file in a subsystem folder already than to move multiple files to a new subsystem folder when you have a lot
2015-05-13 23:55:47	+irinix	^^^
2015-05-13 23:56:41	+tm512	the most complicated system I've done had three folders of source code, client, server, and common
2015-05-13 23:57:24	+tm512	having to type out src/com/what/the/fuck/thing/thing.java would quickly tire
2015-05-13 23:57:32	+tm512	even with tab completion
2015-05-13 23:58:11	grim001	never need to do that when using an IDE

2015-05-13 23:59:09	MrBushido	i do it a lot with c++, i dont have to type paths very often, but when working in a particular system i do have to jump back and forth betweeen multiple files quite frequently
2015-05-13 23:59:27	MrBushido	and when there are only 5 files for 5 classes in a folder, it's easier to navigate to them

2015-05-19 16:02:38	boblehest	Hmm, so I'm getting rid of my yaml-cpp dependency. I tried using protocol buffers for my config files, but the text format is horrible for that purpose. Way too verbose. :/
2015-05-19 16:02:44	boblehest	I guess it's on to JSON then.
2015-05-19 16:03:18	boblehest	Mainly because yaml-cpp depends on a boost library, and I really don't want to depend on any boost libraries.

2015-05-19 16:14:11	+tm512	it is basically as easy as taking a line, splitting it at the '=', and discarding whitespace on either side of the =, then you have a key and a value to store somewhere
2015-05-19 16:14:12	boblehest	I have _lots_ of config files. And if I'm gonna update my own parser to include all the features I need, I'm gonna spend more time than I'd like inventing a format that noone is familiar with.

2015-05-19 17:11:58	+tm512	though, it's basically useless in this case
2015-05-19 17:12:06	boblehest	tm512: I don't see how C++ strings are slower. I assume he did it because he didn't bother to learn how to use C++ allocators.

2015-05-19 17:16:12	BlackFox	pascal strings are the ones which have length of string as a word or a byte, rather than terminating byte

2015-05-19 17:16:33	BlackFox	they are bit more complex to write string operations for I suppose, in a way
2015-05-19 17:16:42	BlackFox	ExpiredPopsicle, well, I mean, there's two classic types of strings
2015-05-19 17:16:46	BlackFox	pascal strings and C strings
2015-05-19 17:16:55	BlackFox	there's more which I forgot
2015-05-19 17:17:13	+tm512	ExpiredPopsicle: well, C strings are something you get used to. for manipulating text I would use shell scripts, not C, however.
2015-05-19 17:17:15	BlackFox	because back in ancient computing era, you had the terminated C strings and the borland pascal compiler which used length byte
2015-05-19 17:17:25	+tm512	but a bit of C strings do not really hurt
2015-05-19 17:17:31	BlackFox	pascal was pretty rad once

2015-05-19 17:20:27	ExpiredPopsicle	I spent the last five and a half years working on an engine written entirely in C. Some of the most horrifying errors that were not related to dumb crap like thread contention were caused by bad C string manipulation.
2015-05-19 17:20:47	+tm512	now, what does suck, really hard, is C wide strings
2015-05-19 17:20:53	BlackFox	should have written the engine in C+lua rather than C
2015-05-19 17:20:59	+tm512	which is like a blemish on an otherwise awesome language
2015-05-19 17:21:10	BlackFox	never too late to completely rewrite everything from scratch and waste months of work

2015-05-19 17:22:05	+tm512	if you are careful you will not run into string issues in C
2015-05-19 17:22:40	BlackFox	I only relatively recently learned that strncpy's length parameter is max number of bytes it will copy, not max length of target
2015-05-19 17:22:41	+tm512	and, well, mistakes happen anyway, so it's useful to recognize the kinds of errors they make

2015-05-19 17:24:25	+tm512	that is how libc is programmed, because of static linking

2015-05-19 17:26:15	+CloudPop	Yeah so I created a level editor with about 43 different entities that can have a wide array of properties depending on what they are.
2015-05-19 17:26:20	ExpiredPopsicle	Yeah. At the very lowest level, a C++ wrapper around C strings with an inline implementation would have only the overhead of the additional type information in the binary.

2015-05-19 17:31:56	BlackFox	my line of work means a lot of fixed-length strings, so it's all fine :V
2015-05-19 17:32:20	BlackFox	also I realized that I meant strncat or whatever
2015-05-19 17:32:27	BlackFox	strncpy, strncat, they both share the same issues
2015-05-19 17:32:31	BlackFox	as described above
2015-05-19 17:33:27	+tm512	I hope you aren't using strncpy to duplicate strings
2015-05-19 17:35:05	+vraid	carefish: hah :p
2015-05-19 17:35:41	BlackFox	tm512, I can just use memcpy as all strings are fixed sized
2015-05-19 17:35:43	BlackFox	in my cae
2015-05-19 17:35:44	+vraid	is it impossible to encapsulate c strings in some sane way?
2015-05-19 17:35:45	BlackFox	case*
2015-05-19 17:35:55	BlackFox	vraid, dude you can do just about anything
2015-05-19 17:36:12	BlackFox	there's probably a ton of string libs for pure C
2015-05-19 17:37:49	+tm512	BlackFox: just use strdup
2015-05-19 17:38:13	+tm512	I was like "oh..." the first time someone told me about it
2015-05-19 17:38:14	BlackFox	oh, no, no memory allocation involved
2015-05-19 17:38:20	+tm512	ah heh
2015-05-19 17:38:25	BlackFox	like
2015-05-19 17:38:32	BlackFox	I never use implicit allocation functions
2015-05-19 17:38:35	BlackFox	so strdup is definitely not for me
2015-05-19 17:38:41	BlackFox	only explicit allocation
2015-05-19 17:39:15	+tm512	the memory returned by strdup can be freed with free()
2015-05-19 17:39:22	BlackFox	but what allocated this memory :D
2015-05-19 17:39:27	+tm512	malloc
2015-05-19 17:39:28	bagnz0r_	strdup
2015-05-19 17:39:28	BlackFox	you will hate implicit allocation if you're writing a windows DLL of some sort, or you do embedded programming
2015-05-19 17:39:30	bagnz0r_	dup - dupa
2015-05-19 17:39:34	bagnz0r_	ass in polish
2015-05-19 17:39:35	ExpiredPopsicle	Well, you want to be able to use stack memory too.
2015-05-19 17:39:35	BlackFox	tm512, okay, but what if you don't wanna use malloc
2015-05-19 17:39:37	bagnz0r_	string ass
2015-05-19 17:39:46	BlackFox	but you want to use somewrapped_malloc() instead
2015-05-19 17:40:19	+tm512	you can make your own strdup then instead, I guess
2015-05-19 17:40:24	BlackFox	you'll probably get the hint on what I mean if you wrote windows DLL's which have to work with heap of the parent application
2015-05-19 17:40:45	+tm512	I don't program for windows
2015-05-19 17:40:49	BlackFox	because DLL gets its own heap, if you strdup inside DLL and then free it inside application, you get mysterious random behavior (heap corruption)

2015-05-19 17:41:08	BlackFox	tm512, and in embedded programming implicit allocation is just bad because it's not always clear where things get allocated
2015-05-19 17:41:14	BlackFox	that's a non-windows reason which is more relevant for me

2015-05-19 17:43:26	BlackFox	carefish, at my current work, I'm only required to produce stuff that operates under all conditions and isn't going to be the weakest link/point of failure
2015-05-19 17:43:40	BlackFox	and otherwise to everyone else it's a black box

2015-05-19 17:44:22	BlackFox	so far my stuff was never the issue
2015-05-19 17:44:37	BlackFox	there's a really crap piece of software that does something
2015-05-19 17:44:40	BlackFox	and it always fails
2015-05-19 17:44:53	BlackFox	but even when all failed, my thingy kept operating
2015-05-19 17:45:01	carefish	nice :)

2015-05-19 17:45:17	+vraid	tm512: did anything come out of the scheme you were doing a while back?
2015-05-19 17:45:23	BlackFox	It might not sound like much, but it was the only thing that allowed us to find the target object in grass, on a test range
2015-05-19 17:45:36	+tm512	vraid: besides frustration?
2015-05-19 17:45:39	+vraid	:D
2015-05-19 17:45:41	BlackFox	basically it crash-landed somewhere where you can't go out on foot because unexploded ammunition
2015-05-19 17:45:45	BlackFox	so we went out driving in tank
2015-05-19 17:45:50	carefish	you're working on those guided laser bullets BlackFox ?
2015-05-19 17:45:57	BlackFox	I was inside the tank with a laptop, my partner was with antenna outside (mostly outside)
2015-05-19 17:46:13	+vraid	tm512: not with strings, i hope!
2015-05-19 17:46:19	BlackFox	my little thing was still sending radiosignals, and so we found it by signal strength, despite everything failing it kept on working
2015-05-19 17:46:19	D34dp4n	Just have access to a tank to stroll out in huh?
2015-05-19 17:46:20	D34dp4n	cool
2015-05-19 17:46:23	BlackFox	D34dp4n, yes :V
2015-05-19 17:46:31	BlackFox	not a tank specifically, more like an APC

2015-05-19 17:46:34	+tm512	I ended up liking scheme quite a bit, but the garbage collector and lack of low-level stuff just made it unsuitable for what I was doing

2015-05-19 18:07:01	BlackFox	This one is similar concrete blocks
2015-05-19 18:07:27	BlackFox	the main graphical issue is where the block idents are (like, the parts which go inside wall)
2015-05-19 18:07:35	BlackFox	the texture mapping and normal mapping are a little broken there

2015-05-19 18:10:29	BlackFox	IRL the concrete parts don't have knife sharp edges like they do in-game right now
2015-05-19 18:12:15	BlackFox	what I need to do is add a ring of vertices there so the normals get correctly interpolated on the edge

2015-05-19 18:13:18	BlackFox	and set everything to smooth
2015-05-19 18:13:33	BlackFox	so the long edges between red and green are flat, but the little corner gets nicely smoothed out

2015-05-25 10:27:51	synthmeat	i mentioned that indie (movies) is better than ever too
2015-05-25 10:27:58	+Axord	I assume the unifying concept is <synthmeat> it's all about risk-reduction and predictability
2015-05-25 10:28:08	synthmeat	yeah
2015-05-25 10:28:40	synthmeat	why am i repeating this, there's log and he was there? :D
2015-05-25 10:28:43	Subspice	I see
2015-05-25 10:29:02	+Axord	Which is a totally understandable business strategy when orgs get big and competition is fierce.
2015-05-25 10:29:12	Subspice	I wasn't sure if I had missed something and I couldn't really see the connection to the gaming industry.
2015-05-25 10:29:35	synthmeat	i love this movie https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvIc0iFGPnw

2015-05-25 10:40:02	Jeffool	Eh, I don't know super hero movies were minimizing risks when Iron Man and the few after it came out.
2015-05-25 10:40:29	Subspice	my coat with my bus card and wallet and passport are locked inside a room. The keycard I need to get in the room is also in the wallet.
2015-05-25 10:40:35	Subspice	le fu
2015-05-25 10:40:35	Jeffool	I mean, "big action film" was a standard method, but "old super hero" is a bit risky compared to a lot of fare.
2015-05-25 10:40:42	Jeffool	Ouch.
2015-05-25 10:40:46	Subspice	:D
2015-05-25 10:41:01	Subspice	I need to bump into someone who can get in there also.
2015-05-25 10:42:34	+Axord	Jeffool: I believe the thinking is that risk is reduced because there's a fan base for the property already.

2015-05-25 10:45:35	+Axord	And definitely marvel's shared movie universe was viewed as a huge risk before it proved itself.

2015-05-25 10:49:21	synthmeat	and that's shit ton of money

2015-05-25 10:50:45	Subspice	Also, not all superheroes fare well. Like... did Hellboy do good? Green Lantern?
2015-05-25 10:50:53	synthmeat	hellboy did awesome
2015-05-25 10:51:04	synthmeat	green lantern did ok for what it was and when it was
2015-05-25 10:51:09	Joybane	Hellboy did so well it got a sequel.
2015-05-25 10:51:12	Jeffool	I don't really understand that statement. Marvel did an origin story for each of'em in their first films.
2015-05-25 10:51:17	Jeffool	And Hellboy was great.

2015-05-25 10:53:28	synthmeat	oh, wow
2015-05-25 10:53:49	synthmeat	oh, but it barely beat the budget
2015-05-25 10:53:50	Joybane	People compare GL against Marvel's hits and it looked like a stunning failure,
2015-05-25 10:54:04	Tesrym	200 gaben
2015-05-25 10:54:07	Ashedragon	that's just silly though
2015-05-25 10:54:08	synthmeat	(which is apparently pretty damn fine for hollywood dudes)
2015-05-25 10:54:16	Joybane	But the reality is despite serious, serious movie mistakes (reshoots, CGing a guy who literally graced fitness mag covers) it beat the budget domestically
2015-05-25 10:54:19	+Axord	Insufficient gaben error.
2015-05-25 10:54:22	Joybane	Meaning international revenue was pure profit.

2015-05-25 11:26:10	+zebbiz_pi	Eddie Meduza has done tons of songs
2015-05-25 11:26:11	Entalyan	Runke Balle by Eddie Meduza.
2015-05-25 11:26:15	+zebbiz_pi	lol
2015-05-25 11:26:49	+zebbiz_pi	not the same as "runka bulle"
2015-05-25 11:27:43	Subspice	I knew this really hot girl called Josefin
2015-05-25 11:27:47	Entalyan	Yes, the videoclip does contain a 30+ second shot of a man doing a guitarsolo while performing the helicopterdick, and also a 30+ second shot of a relatively small penis being jerked softly
2015-05-25 11:28:03	Subspice	So Eddie Meduza's song makes me think of her because she found the song funny
2015-05-25 11:28:17	Entalyan	The rest is weird closeups of the guys face, sometimes while he's wearing a fake moustache
