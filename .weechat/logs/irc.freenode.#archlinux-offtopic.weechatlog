2015-04-05 18:58:29	stardome_	well oats, depending on which web browser you choose that's likely the next long compile, esp if firefox is the choice

2015-04-05 19:02:15	oats	yeah
2015-04-05 19:02:22	oats	I'll probably setup distcc at some point
2015-04-05 19:02:24	oats	although
2015-04-05 19:02:35	oats	does it work across different architectures?
2015-04-05 19:02:49	oats	x86 & x86_64
2015-04-05 19:03:12	stardome_	yes, but it requires special setup
2015-04-05 19:03:23	oats	no problem
2015-04-05 19:03:36	stardome_	also want to make sure that your use flags are read accordingly from the desired install machine
2015-04-05 19:03:38	oats	don't want to wait an additional hour whenever there's a kenel update
2015-04-05 19:03:44	oats	or wait 6 hours for xorg

2015-04-05 20:03:19	@meskarune	I think the main thing I would use is moving windows from one session to another

2015-04-08 01:25:47	shanemikel	Trying to get php sqlite.so module working...
2015-04-08 01:25:58	shanemikel	or installed
2015-04-08 01:26:03	+woddf2	mankypirate: I've seen a nick-changing spammer in #freenode recently.
2015-04-08 01:27:38	shanemikel	I'm failing on this one, I need the function based sqlite library not the OOP one, but it seems as if It's not built-in anymore, anybody know if it's in the aur, or somewhere else
2015-04-08 01:28:32	+klekowskii	shanemikel, I'm like super wasted, but I think you need to install the package and at the same time change your php config in order to the "server" to get it 
2015-04-08 01:29:00	+klekowskii	but then again, you should not trust me as I'm in a very different mood right not and not paying attention into technical stuff 
2015-04-08 01:30:05	+klekowskii	some of the clever people here should take over this conversations if it is indeed needed, but I think you are missing something easy here 
2015-04-08 01:30:37	+klekowskii	I politely ask you to RTFM as sqlite is a very common thing among my servers and I think everyone's else 
2015-04-08 01:32:50	+klekowskii	and in case is easy, AUR should never be your point of reference, me myselft compile everything that is not in arch by hand 
2015-04-08 01:33:27	shanemikel	I think the issue here, is I'm trying to use the sqlite 2 driver, which is outdated and no longer maintained, but I think it's still possible to get it compiled, I just cant figure how

2015-04-08 01:34:11	shanemikel	I have to compile the entirety of php?
2015-04-08 01:34:51	+klekowskii	no idea dude, I certainly have no clue of what function you need nor I'm enough aware of php in order to answer that question 
2015-04-08 01:35:25	+klekowskii	but as a geeky dude, yeah , recompile everything, take the edge out of lame packagers

2015-04-08 05:42:08	andrewSC	it's amazing
2015-04-08 05:42:54	dunz0r	I guess it's because they don't want people to "abuse" the system, but I doubt that anyone does that, at least not very often

2015-04-27 13:16:10	SysGh0st	Why oh why is so many moving from youtube to vessel? What's so great about it? For me (A user) it's yet another account to  a company that will track me and my clicks. Worst of all I can't get vessel to play back videos properly. Its like going back to the very first youtube when everything kept buffering over and over and over... /rant
2015-04-27 13:21:25	Serpentoj	Vessel?  What newfangled thing that I've never heard of is this?
2015-04-27 13:22:23	fengshaun_	by doing umask(0), are you saying you want the daemonized process to create files with 0777?
2015-04-27 13:22:37	fengshaun_	is that how umask works?
2015-04-27 13:23:11	Achillion	Serpentoj: new video service
2015-04-27 13:23:12	dagle	SysGh0st: Never heard of it.
2015-04-27 13:24:17	Achillion	SysGh0st: good competition since content creators that make their money on YT are basically forced to accept any and all deals that YT puts forth. Vessel is experimenting with different revenue models, sorta combining patreon with YT
2015-04-27 13:24:36	dagle	fengshaun_: all files are created by 777, umask is "minus" (mask) that.
2015-04-27 13:24:56	dagle	Hence, umask(222) -> 777 - 222 = 555
2015-04-27 13:25:03	SysGh0st	Vessel. a new video hosting site, like youtube. asome of the channels I subscribe to are starting to move over there. But as of now it's just yet another more localised hosting service that doesn't work as well as youtube. Keeps buffering on me.
2015-04-27 13:25:29	Achillion	I kinda like it. It's smooth and has a nice design.
2015-04-27 13:26:10	Achillion	The design is clearly more focused towards watching the video than anything else. E.g., scrolling the page while you're watching doesn't remove the video from site, so you can glance at the relevant vids or the comments while still watching.
2015-04-27 13:27:19	Serpentoj	Who reads YouTube comments, anyway?  That's how you lose brain cells.  :P
2015-04-27 13:27:21	Achillion	I just signed up through the "science" group cause Veritasium and Minute Physics were on it.
2015-04-27 13:27:40	Achillion	They asked nicely and said it supports their channel so I did.
2015-04-27 13:27:42	woddf2	Serpentoj: It depends on the video(s), I guess.  :-P
2015-04-27 13:27:52	dagle	I need to sign up on vessel to watch shit?
2015-04-27 13:27:54	dagle	FUCK THAT
2015-04-27 13:28:21	SysGh0st	Achillion: I did for the same reason. But I'm a bit dissapointed with all the buffering.
2015-04-27 13:28:36	Achillion	Never had that issue. If it's as bad as you say, then yeah I'm sure it's annoying.

2015-04-28 07:47:18	dexter	Just a learning curve.

2015-05-10 19:38:22	crazedpsyc	if microsoft ported and shipped pacman... oh man.
2015-05-10 19:38:37	LambdaComplex	...Where would it look though?
2015-05-10 19:38:43	LambdaComplex	Installing Linux packages wouldn't exactly work
2015-05-10 19:38:52	crazedpsyc	ports.microsoft.com
2015-05-10 19:39:37	crazedpsyc	which would of course be an auto-rebranding desynced mirror of cygwin
2015-05-10 19:39:55	Hwkiller	LambdaComplex: pacman isn't linux-specific, per se, in its packaging
2015-05-10 19:40:37	Hwkiller	all makepkg does is build a project, install a project into a folder similar to one's root system, then pacman unrolls that onto the root fs and records wtf it did.
2015-05-10 19:40:39	crazedpsyc	oh it would be so great to see microsoft abusing ABS :')
2015-05-10 19:40:42	LambdaComplex	Hwkiller: Right, but pointing it to the Arch repo(s) wouldn't exactly make sense
2015-05-10 19:40:49	Hwkiller	LambdaComplex: lol, well of course not
2015-05-10 19:40:59	crazedpsyc	archbsd and others don't do that either, though

2015-05-10 21:44:46	kennae	well, I have maybe 30 played dota2 games since the release of first beta wave but some of the players are 6k mmr but still lax

2015-05-10 21:49:00	dexter	I don't play DoTA because I don't know how and the community is terrible
2015-05-10 21:49:11	dexter	if I try to learn I get screamed at by a bunch of russians O_O

2015-05-10 21:50:23	kennae	there is years of learning, I don't deny, but you can enjoy it with quite easily these years
2015-05-10 21:50:42	dexter	I was fairly soured by the experience. All I saw was "GO BOT GO TOP GO MID IDIOT WAT R U DOIN"
2015-05-10 21:50:56	dexter	ruined the entire genre for me, not that I much cared for it to begin with.
2015-05-10 21:51:06	fengshaun	lol how typical
2015-05-10 21:51:11	kennae	yeah, people assume you have played atleast few hundred games and you should know everything always

2015-05-10 21:52:11	kennae	dexter: if you could see how it was when dota was becoming played more and more and there was so much elitist
2015-05-10 21:52:11	dexter	and then they started screaming BOT BOT BOT BOT BOT
2015-05-10 21:52:29	dexter	and I don't know if they were telling me to go to the bottom or accusing me of being a bot
2015-05-10 21:52:30	kennae	I had over 2000 ppl on my ban list because they made like one mistake or some shit
2015-05-10 21:52:35	dexter	o_o
2015-05-10 21:52:50	kennae	and I didn't play on the official servers that had most players
2015-05-10 21:52:53	kennae	so that tells something
2015-05-10 21:53:20	kennae	but now there is automatic system that puts you to play with ppl that is near your skill level, atleast in theory
2015-05-10 21:54:08	kennae	back in the day it was like, you aren't juggernaut and bought boots first item, perm ban and remake the game
2015-05-10 21:54:11	kennae	so horrible
2015-05-10 21:54:34	kennae	like the worst of 4chan trying to agitate themselves and still somehow had to play it
2015-05-10 21:54:54	dexter	seems like an accurate description
2015-05-10 21:55:19	fengshaun	dexter: just go through the tutorial and we can play together and have fnu

2015-05-10 21:55:52	kennae	there is tutorial other than purge's "welcome to dota, you suck"?

2015-05-10 21:56:07	kennae	maybe I should check it out too
2015-05-10 21:56:10	fengshaun	although the "you suck" article is nice
2015-05-10 21:56:15	fengshaun	it's *very* basic
2015-05-10 21:56:18	fengshaun	don't bother
2015-05-10 21:56:23	polyzen	you bother
2015-05-10 21:56:32	kennae	dota was more basic back when it was made :P
2015-05-10 21:56:35	dexter	in soviet russia, bother you!
2015-05-10 21:56:37	kennae	and the meta has changed etc.
2015-05-10 21:57:11	kennae	and yeah dexter, if you feel like you woudn't enjoy it I don't say its a bad choice just to leave it
2015-05-10 21:57:52	fengshaun	it's a really fun game if you play with voice
2015-05-10 21:58:01	fengshaun	pub games not as fun
2015-05-10 21:58:16	dexter	I'm more of an mmorpg fan. Games like eve and WoW.
2015-05-10 21:58:38	dexter	I liked the original starcraft and wc3 but those were the last RTS games I ever enjoyed.
2015-05-10 21:59:02	dexter	I spent months trying to beat tarpit defense. I never did. And this makes me sad. :(
2015-05-10 21:59:10	kennae	I never enjoyed rts in multiplayer because the micro had to be so fast
2015-05-10 21:59:11	dexter	made a lot of good friends playing that map.
2015-05-10 21:59:13	kennae	never bothered to learn
2015-05-10 21:59:37	dexter	diablo 2 was amazing too. 3 is crapola.
2015-05-10 21:59:56	kennae	diablo 3 season 1 was pretty fun if you ask me
2015-05-10 22:00:28	kennae	it is really casual but in hardcore it is fun, but not as much fun as at the release of d3 hardcore

2015-05-10 22:00:49	dexter	Release was fun. I played a lot for a couple months. And now I just can't get back into it.
2015-05-10 22:01:23	dexter	I really tried too, because I wanted to play the crusader and see what max level skills were like.
2015-05-10 22:01:41	kennae	I only played at launch for few months, got quite far at hc and then just found it impossible and quit it till I played again in the season 1 and noticed there has been MASSIVE improvements for nearly everything
2015-05-10 22:01:41	dexter	think my highest crusader was like 40 something before I gave up :(
2015-05-10 22:02:16	kennae	when ros came I leveled crusader from 1 to 70 in one sitting solo with just playing the campaign

2015-05-10 22:36:13	kennae	usually when you have used arch for some time you just need to think about what you need to achieve and doing that is almost always simple

2015-05-10 22:37:06	archsg	Meh. I'm not lazy. Not really. When I really want to figure out how to do something I just begin searching until I find something that explains it. Whether that's searching manuals, reading comments in configuration files, or searching the internet.
2015-05-10 22:37:53	archsg	Like I figured out resolvconf.conf recently. Just read the manual on it. I remember when it was just /etc/resolv.conf and modifying your dhcpcd settings to prevent clobbering.
2015-05-10 22:37:55	kennae	same here really, but some things just cause too little harm to get me interested in even typing the command
2015-05-10 22:37:57	archsg	The resolvconf.conf is genius.
2015-05-10 22:38:44	jakedust	archsg: resolv.conf is a file to be edited to point to 8.8.8.8, and that's it
2015-05-10 22:38:50	kennae	the funny thing is I first installed arch as my main desktop os many many years ago and been loving the simplicity since
2015-05-10 22:39:00	archsg	...
2015-05-10 22:40:37	kennae	my resolvconf just has opendns in it and that only because I wanted to a try if I can see a difference anywhere
2015-05-10 22:41:18	kennae	or since we are in geeky channel, I correct, it has opendns dns servers there as my nameserver
2015-05-10 22:41:21	archsg	I use OpenNIC or OpenDNS too. At least I do when I'm not using mobile hotspot. 
2015-05-10 22:41:46	kennae	what is bad in using opendns on mobile connection also?
2015-05-10 22:41:47	archsg	For whatever reason my mobile hotspot won't do a damned thing if I modify my nameservers. It just sits there like an idiot and won't load anything.
2015-05-10 22:42:07	kennae	oh, that explains my question
2015-05-10 22:42:26	woddf2	_For now_, I use my ISP (Charter)'s default nameserver(s).  I was able to disable the NXDOMAIN redirection quickly, and that actually works.
2015-05-10 22:42:32	jakedust	I just use both Google servers (8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4) because they tend to be both better than my ISP's nameservers (when at home) and internal nameservers at work
2015-05-10 22:42:57	woddf2	(With Windstream, I _had_ to use some other DNS server because theirs did NXDOMAIN hijacking no matter what.)
2015-05-10 22:43:09	archsg	I use anything other than the default when I'm anywhere else. Since I can't actually get internet in my apartment I have to use a mobile hotspot. But when I'm out and about in the city I use OpenDNS or OpenNIC.
2015-05-10 22:43:31	woddf2	archsg: "Since I can't actually get internet in my apartment"  ...rural area?
2015-05-10 22:43:36	archsg	Yep.
2015-05-10 22:43:43	kennae	jakedust: google steals your moneys
2015-05-10 22:43:49	kennae	pls no use it
2015-05-10 22:43:50	archsg	It's... a complicated personal living situation.
2015-05-10 22:43:50	woddf2	archsg: ...too many trees for satellite?  DSL doesn't reach?
2015-05-10 22:44:21	jakedust	kennae: my brain is too limited to remember any other nameservers' IPs, unfortunately

2015-05-10 22:44:54	archsg	No, I live in downtown. It's complicated. Basically the owners won't allow me to purchase internet and get it installed here because of all the wiring problems and... like I said it's difficult to explain and would reveal TMI.
2015-05-10 22:45:02	kennae	and just as a hint: there is no need to remember much of stuff yourself nowdays
2015-05-10 22:45:05	woddf2	archsg: Oh  :-(
2015-05-10 22:45:26	jakedust	this is one of the things I hate about $DAYJOB: we have a nice ops team for production and serious stuff, and a bunch of awful people for the internal stuff
2015-05-10 22:45:53	kennae	we got so fine 4G in my little town that there is really no reason to get a hard line

2015-05-10 22:46:34	jakedust	kennae: 4G is wonderful, even nowadays my phone's 4G connection is better than my landline (15~20Mbps v. 8Mbps)
2015-05-10 22:47:02	archsg	Also I don't use Google, I use startpage.com or duckduckgo.com

2015-05-11 00:31:28	grawity	I'm curious how much of that is valid

2015-05-19 11:58:25	TylerDurden01	Funny thing about antidepressants is that they'd make me crave alcohol and would make me tolerant to it. Now that I'm stopping them, I can barely drink and get really tired after just 1/3 of what I previously binged on.
2015-05-19 11:58:38	TylerDurden01	It's not fun anymore either. It's just... becoming sleepy.

2015-05-19 12:00:17	mar77i	mankypirate: you haven't repeated it enough times that we'd believe you and I wanted to help in making repeating it a little easier.
2015-05-19 12:00:34	TylerDurden01	mar77i: meh, before taking the antidepressant, I was a radical teetotaler for 99% of my life
2015-05-19 12:01:16	TylerDurden01	mar77i: after some time, I realized that wine tasted way better while on the antidepressant and managed to drink like 1L of it in one sitting :D
2015-05-19 12:01:33	mar77i	are you glad to know why you weren't drinking? :)
2015-05-19 12:01:43	TylerDurden01	So in some way, they kinda made me... normal :D
2015-05-19 12:02:04	mar77i	it's kind of sad that only the antidepressants made you sad enough to drink
2015-05-19 12:02:56	TylerDurden01	mar77i: oh, I wasn't sad on them, but wasn't happy either; I was emotionally stable. I think of them as compromises.
2015-05-19 12:03:49	mar77i	hmm. it's sad enough one can't live up to one's standards to not have to resort to depression.

2015-05-19 12:13:20	mar77i	actually we're all gonna die and don't live up to our expectation about life, people's impression on us and some of the very basic things we think we need are out of reach. but there's a certain helplessness to it, a distance, and let me call it lethargy.
2015-05-19 12:13:29	eto	yeah depression is fucking nightmare, you can feel like shit, your mind sabotaging you every second, barely make each day, be broke and it still won't feel luxurious at all
2015-05-19 12:14:47	mar77i	I actually crave that lethargy. it's STABLE.
2015-05-19 12:14:51	eto	mar77i: people with real depression usually don't tell others they have it :)
2015-05-19 12:15:10	eto	lethargy is not depression though
2015-05-19 12:15:48	mar77i	of course not. but it's doing one wrong for getting nothing out of the other.
2015-05-19 12:16:49	eto	well great thing about depression is doctors can make you high and happy at least for some time
2015-05-19 12:17:01	eto	the problem is going off meds
2015-05-19 12:17:53	eto	i bet quite a number of people without access to drugs ends up offing themselves
2015-05-19 12:18:12	TylerDurden01	Sometimes I wonder if I faked being mentally ill in the past. That I was just being melodramatic and could've stopped at any time. But then I reach crisis points and I remember why I was an asshole to everyone in my life.
2015-05-19 12:18:22	eto	i wouldn't say it's luxury at all

2015-05-19 12:19:53	mar77i	always good to know, the guy I probably most disappointed in my life was probably myself, so I can't tell you not to be an asshole.

2015-05-19 12:21:14	TylerDurden01	eto: and saying that you can be an asshole to people as long as you fix it later isn't really moral

2015-05-19 12:29:12	halcyon_b	SysGhost That's true, it's pretty minimalist.  I don't usually need anything except for ROM compatibility and savestates.

2015-05-19 12:40:15	mar77i	z80 is essentially what intel tweaked further. 6502 only had three registers and only one value-like argument to opcodes, if any.
2015-05-19 12:40:39	 *	SysGhost remember learning to make some nice fire effects, in DOS 320x200 256 color mode, in assembler at school around late 90's to early 00.

2015-05-19 15:33:12	sd1001	Well, it was wrong in the way that the guy it was meant to didn't get the message
2015-05-19 15:33:25	sd1001	And of course it worked for him to just turn it off and on again :)

2015-05-19 15:54:12	sd1001	Or maybe not
2015-05-19 15:55:08	mar77i	well it would confront them with a definitely solveable problem... since all problems to which the source code exists can, at least in theory, be solved.

2015-05-19 15:56:02	mar77i	likely enough you'll get them to "we repair all - except sd1001's linux - computers"
2015-05-19 15:56:43	mar77i	but that would be helpful on its own, because the word linux is used once more.

2015-05-25 10:51:21	Achillion	I don't know if Ren & Stimpy qualifies as a kid's cartoon.
2015-05-25 10:51:59	Achillion	heh "Throughout its run, the show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, and violence which were rare for television animation of that time. This controversy contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department."
2015-05-25 10:52:40	TylerDurden01	Achillion: wiki says that it was meant for Nickoleodon, so that means that it's a kid's cartoon
2015-05-25 10:52:51	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, you have no idea what they've been sticking in kids cartoons for decades

2015-05-25 10:53:52	TylerDurden01	GI_Jack: I was born in '93 and looking at what kids are watching these days, it's way tamer, more for idiots, but at least they're not screwed up
2015-05-25 10:54:17	TylerDurden01	(though, I've caught only glimpses of modern cartoons)
2015-05-25 10:54:25	Achillion	The person you took your nickname from literally made it his point to fuck with people by splicing porn into cartoons at movie theatres. :P
2015-05-25 10:54:26	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, are you one of those people who think that if kids see one sexual reference in a cartoon they are going to grow up to be homosexual drug using satanist science practicioners?
2015-05-25 10:54:45	Achillion	Also, cartoons these days are much better than anything we were subject to in the 80s and 90s.
2015-05-25 10:54:53	GI_Jack	Achillion, yes and no
2015-05-25 10:54:57	GI_Jack	today does have some good cartoons
2015-05-25 10:55:00	Achillion	80s cartoons were quite literally year-long toy commercials.
2015-05-25 10:55:00	TylerDurden01	GI_Jack: /facepalm
2015-05-25 10:55:01	GI_Jack	but there was always good cartoons
2015-05-25 10:55:12	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, I take that as a yes, get off my internets
2015-05-25 10:55:37	TylerDurden01	Achillion: look, kids, a ROBOT that transforms into a LUXURIOUS car! What does that mean? :D
2015-05-25 10:56:08	GI_Jack	is Spongebob squarepants still considered "today"
2015-05-25 10:56:12	GI_Jack	thats been around over a decade now
2015-05-25 10:56:15	GI_Jack	that has adult refrences
2015-05-25 10:56:15	Achillion	GI_Jack: I'll concede that there were great cartoons before and during my time. I do think that cartoons these days are generally better, or that there are more good cartoons now than there were before. I have no stats to back that up.
2015-05-25 10:56:34	GI_Jack	Achillion, I think I must concede "more good ones"
2015-05-25 10:56:57	GI_Jack	and yes, looking back 80s cartoons where mostly toy sales
2015-05-25 10:56:58	Achillion	The currently running Nickelodeon TMNT show is pretty great, btw :)
2015-05-25 10:57:11	TylerDurden01	Achillion: since Pokemon's still a thing even among manchildren, I think that the marketting strategies of the 80s and 90s really worked
2015-05-25 10:57:27	TylerDurden01	Shocking as that may sound
2015-05-25 10:57:31	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, its now 30 somethings reliving their youth through "retro"
2015-05-25 10:57:35	GI_Jack	its somewhat sad
2015-05-25 10:57:43	Achillion	There is no doubt in my mind that they worked. I still think Transformers toys were great.
2015-05-25 10:57:44	GI_Jack	the way I see it, is they are all pissing on my childhood

2015-05-25 11:00:23	GI_Jack	nope
2015-05-25 11:00:34	GI_Jack	as a kid you are too young to understand many things

2015-05-25 11:02:33	Achillion	I could be less lazy, but I don't blame anyone but myself for that one.
2015-05-25 11:02:51	GI_Jack	my mom blamed me for most of the problems in her life

2015-05-25 11:05:05	GI_Jack	the older I got the more I realized what a thin grasp she had, and her only real means of advancement was threatening and yelling at people, threats backed up by conning other people into doing her dirty work

2015-05-25 11:20:28	GI_Jack	or what we have now are prison like schools to "protect the children"
2015-05-25 11:20:32	GI_Jack	from what?
2015-05-25 11:20:45	TylerDurden01	*waiting to go back

2015-05-25 11:20:51	GI_Jack	how many children are protected from this police state?
2015-05-25 11:21:03	GI_Jack	how many lives are ruined by harrassment from school officials
2015-05-25 11:21:25	GI_Jack	how can we teach kids about freedom and democracy while pounding obedence to authority over factual correctness
2015-05-25 11:21:44	TylerDurden01	GI_Jack: anti-authority? Hmm. I'm beginning to form a mental image of you. :P
2015-05-25 11:21:56	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, oh, I've already got one about you
2015-05-25 11:22:18	GI_Jack	Paranoia about social enemies is why we have the largest prison system in the world
2015-05-25 11:22:21	GI_Jack	its why we fight wars
2015-05-25 11:22:31	crazedpsyc	TylerDurden01 looks like brad pitt in my mind
2015-05-25 11:22:32	GI_Jack	its why we don't trust our neighbors

2015-05-25 11:22:38	crazedpsyc	but that's just me
2015-05-25 11:23:12	GI_Jack	Its why we think the answer to all social problems involves incarceration
2015-05-25 11:23:36	GI_Jack	its why we think of "mental health" as another version of incarceration
2015-05-25 11:24:16	GI_Jack	TylerDurden01, but feel free to lump everyone who questions any bit of authority into a single catagory
2015-05-25 11:24:30	GI_Jack	How many people did stalin murder
2015-05-25 11:24:34	GI_Jack	how many would you?

2015-05-25 11:25:30	TylerDurden01	GI_Jack: so that's a moot point
2015-05-25 11:25:40	GI_Jack	of course not, it was perfect, don't send me to the gulag
2015-05-25 11:26:13	GI_Jack	and no, I don't think it was only the soviet union
2015-05-25 11:26:28	GI_Jack	but I'm not apologizing for any murderous regimes
2015-05-25 11:26:43	GI_Jack	its really not a moot point, except for the fact you said so
