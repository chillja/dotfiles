2015-01-22 17:46:37	FunkyBob	the major point of venv is that you can replicate your env in many places
2015-01-22 17:47:00	FunkyBob	without disturbing other envs
2015-01-22 17:47:09	FunkyBob	[also... mysql? really?]
2015-01-22 17:47:24	comm64x	I'm building something for someone and their server says no to root access
2015-01-22 17:47:38	FunkyBob	you don't need root access for virtualenv
2015-01-22 17:47:40	comm64x	which I would need to install this stuff right?
2015-01-22 17:47:44	FunkyBob	in fact, that's one of its best features
2015-01-22 17:48:01	comm64x	ok so just ssh to remote server
2015-01-22 17:48:16	comm64x	then install virtualenv there
2015-01-22 17:48:26	FunkyBob	if they don't have virtualenv already, just download and extract the tarball for it... it comes with an exxecutable virtualenv.py in it

2015-01-22 17:49:18	FunkyBob	well, you can install the Python packages
2015-01-22 17:49:30	comm64x	would I have to build everything from source
2015-01-22 17:49:34	FunkyBob	caveat that if any need C modules compiled, that may be a problem if the box doesn't have headers installed
2015-01-22 17:49:43	FunkyBob	depends on what you mean by "everything"

2015-01-22 17:50:38	FunkyBob	well, if they don't have python, apache/mod_wsgi installed... you'll probably need them to do that
2015-01-22 17:50:43	FunkyBob	I don't see you running apache without root
2015-01-22 17:51:00	FunkyBob	Django is pure python, but if you use ImageField you'll need Pillow, which isn't
2015-01-22 17:51:11	FunkyBob	haystack... depends on which DB you use for it
2015-01-22 17:51:19	comm64x	mysql innodb
2015-01-22 17:51:52	FunkyBob	well, that's between you and your masochism...
2015-01-22 17:52:14	FunkyBob	so they're asking you to set up a web app on their server.... which [from what you say] has nothing yuo need installed on it?

2015-01-22 17:52:30	FunkyBob	yeah, I was heading towards what zkanda just said
2015-01-22 17:52:35	FunkyBob	why bother with their server at all?
2015-01-22 17:52:50	FunkyBob	I'm not saying they have to give you root access -- they don't
2015-01-22 17:53:10	FunkyBob	but if they're not going to install anything for you [DBMS, web server, python] ... then you're better off not using their server
2015-01-22 17:53:25	mattmcc	Hrm.  Redis is lying to me.
2015-01-22 17:53:30	mattmcc	"Can't save in background: fork: Cannot allocate memory"
2015-01-22 17:53:34	comm64x	wouldnt it be possible to ftp src tarballs for everything to the server and then install it all ./configure-d with --prefix=/my/home/on/server
2015-01-22 17:53:48	mattmcc	Except the DB is ~700mb in memory on a 4GB machine running nothing else.

2015-01-22 17:54:31	FunkyBob	comm64x: why are they so hostile?  why won't their admins install even the basics for you?
2015-01-22 17:54:46	FunkyBob	comm64x: for $5/month you can have a VPS with all the software and root access you want
2015-01-22 17:54:56	zkanda	comm64x: Your gonna run this in port 80 right?
2015-01-22 17:55:10	comm64x	is it really as easy as asking tech support to install something for me?
2015-01-22 17:55:24	mattmcc	Well, that depends on the host.
2015-01-22 17:55:29	comm64x	hostgator

2015-01-22 17:55:53	FunkyBob	hostgator have a habit of upgrading Python without telling you
2015-01-22 17:56:04	FunkyBob	I have a HG reseller account... almost a total waste of money

2015-01-22 17:59:43	mattmcc	Well, you could do it locally..
2015-01-22 18:00:06	FunkyBob	have you not done the tutorial?
2015-01-22 18:00:09	comm64x	thats what I'm trying to do but how would I get it all to the server
2015-01-22 18:00:12	FunkyBob	where you do stuff just using runserver?
2015-01-22 18:00:44	FunkyBob	when you're ready, you use the Linux distro's packages for the binary stuff, and scp your code over... or git clone a repo there
2015-01-22 18:00:45	zkanda	with sqlite?
2015-01-22 18:00:48	zkanda	:)
2015-01-22 18:01:19	comm64x	yes I know but what about when Im ready to go production does it matter?

2015-01-25 19:47:43	surfnturf	If I may throw in my 2c as a newbie and someone who has done a lot of tutorials. IMO the problem with documentation is they tell you too many details you don't need to know at that time. Makes it hard to absorb it all. Tutorials introduce you to select parts of information that go together. Makes it easier to remember.
2015-01-25 19:48:07	surfnturf	documentation is better left for after you have some skills. Its good for reference.

2015-01-25 19:51:40	mattmcc	The login view is documented in about a raw a fashion as imaginable, with the example template being several pages down from the nearest linkable heading.

2015-02-21 17:16:50	krietx	apollo13: I’d like to kick it :)  Their concern is that if someone uploaded a malicious file it may not be removed.  I am using ClamAV to scan the file once uploaded, and it’s fine to limit uploads to 10 MB or under (small Word and PDF documents).  I don’t want to ignore FILE_UPLOAD_MAX_MEMORY_SIZE (like you said—no need for GBs in memory), but is there a way for me to get some feedback once it’s determined to be too large?  I

2015-02-21 17:16:54	nkuttler	firewing1: that's mostly up to taste. if you have multiple apps for one site, the front page usually displays stuff from several apps, so the project's templates dir might make more sense

2015-04-05 20:04:46	sjroot	Say I have an app called Core. Can I include staticfiles (CSS) for the admin in core/static/admin/css/ ?
2015-04-05 20:05:04	FunkyBob	sjroot: yes
2015-04-05 20:05:22	FunkyBob	sjroot: if  you want them to take priority over admins, you need 'core' to be before 'django.contrib.admin' in INSTALLED_APPS
2015-04-05 20:05:34	sjroot	Ahh....that explains a lot
2015-04-05 20:05:37	Guat0n	FunkyBob: thanks...basically search for a set of records and show them on the same page in case the user wants to do a new search...
2015-04-05 20:05:57	ludat	sjroot: collectstaticfiles get every static file for each app in INSTALLED_APPS
2015-04-05 20:06:02	FunkyBob	Guat0n: and why the preference for CBV?
2015-04-05 20:06:24	FunkyBob	since it's a search, you'll be using GET so the "Back/POST behavior" isn't an issue
2015-04-05 20:07:02	Guat0n	FunkyBob: just because CBVs are what i'm using in my current project...
2015-04-05 20:07:36	FunkyBob	Guat0n: well, two things to remember... 1) all views are functions... 2) nothing to stop you mixing CBV and normal views in the one project
2015-04-05 20:08:02	FunkyBob	you could override get_queryset to process the form and apply filtering where approriate
2015-04-05 20:08:16	Guat0n	FunkyBob: yeah i know...if i can get it work i really do not care if it is FBVs or CBVs...
2015-04-05 20:08:17	FunkyBob	but I can't see this functionality really cleanly fitting into any of the CBV APIs
2015-04-05 20:08:34	FunkyBob	do it as a plain function first... then see if you can cleanly fit ot to a cbv
2015-04-05 20:08:48	FunkyBob	but if you're not really benifiting from CBV.. don't use them for this
2015-04-05 20:08:57	FunkyBob	no point making your life harder
2015-04-05 20:09:21	Guat0n	FunkyBob: ok...i'll try the get_queryset approach...
2015-04-05 20:10:29	Guat0n	FunkyBob: thanks for answering my question and sugesting a new approach...i been banging my head on this issue for the whole afternoon and getting a new approach is refreshing to say the least...

2015-04-07 23:21:43	Guddu	mattmcc, Yes. The App was written for 10G and to work with 11g+ they need to upgrade a whole lot. Its still under revision. There is a plan to upgrade it but might take some time.

2015-04-07 23:22:29	Guddu	In the name of corporate policies
2015-04-07 23:23:10	mattmcc	FunkyBob: There is, incidentally.  It's pretty thorough, too.
2015-04-07 23:23:39	FunkyBob	mattmcc: does not surprise me
2015-04-07 23:23:49	FunkyBob	did you see the article recently about FDW for MySQL?

2015-04-07 23:26:54	hillaj	woops
2015-04-07 23:27:11	hillaj	meant to up-return in terminal :)
2015-04-07 23:28:07	hillaj	strange. when the migrations are being generated, the manager's use_in_migrations is True, but the string doesn't exist anywhere in this project
2015-04-07 23:28:24	FunkyBob	is it inherited?
2015-04-07 23:29:19	hillaj	only from django's Manager i think, but i'm investigating...
2015-04-07 23:29:47	mattmcc	Yeah, there's quite a few fdw's these days.  I've pondered playing with the redis one for pre-warming caches.
2015-04-07 23:30:24	mattmcc	Or trigger-based cache invalidation/updating, who knows.. :)

2015-04-08 02:42:49	mattmcc	The only reason for it doing nothing that I'm aware of is if django_migrations already had a record for that app/migration.

It seems that some tests do not clear up the database, as some other tests fail due to spurious objects in the DB. Running those tests in isolation succeeds. All tests we have inherit from django.test.TestCase. Is there a good way of figuring out which tests leave objects in the DB after they ran?

2015-04-08 03:21:24	mattmcc	It's just because it extends the base template, and doesn't hide that block.

2015-04-08 04:16:05	FunkyBob	also, personally, I always make my url names not value python identifiers [by using - as a separator]

2015-04-08 04:16:53	jwhitmore	Hello all, struggling with design or Arch issue. Wanted to put a random photo into the hope page of my site. This page seems good method http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25453432/serve-random-image-with-django  My problem is that the method uses a database table which means that it has to be in an App which means that the site's home page is in a django Application. I'm sure that's only an issue in MY Head.
2015-04-08 04:16:56	Hydraze	FunkyBob: I just noticed it works on my dev computer (python3, 1.7.7) and fails on my prod (python2, django 1.7.6)
2015-04-08 04:16:59	Hydraze	FunkyBob: going to try that
2015-04-08 04:17:35	psmail007	FunkBob: Yep. They are passed to the view. But they are (maybe) not passed to an included url.py file. From my example - url(r'^people/(\d+)/agreements/', include('agreements.urls', namespace="agreements")). Note the included agreement.urls reference.
2015-04-08 04:17:44	Hydraze	does work neither with the .pyc removed
2015-04-08 04:17:44	FunkyBob	jwhitmore: views don't have to be in an app...
2015-04-08 04:17:56	jaykay	FunkyBob: sure, but replacing dots with dashes still doesn't make this dry... i'm just wondering why i should repeat the view name a second time (even if slightly altered)
2015-04-08 04:17:57	FunkyBob	psmail007: yes, they are
2015-04-08 04:18:10	FunkyBob	psmail007: but since you didn't name the group, it's passed as a positional argument to your view

2015-04-08 04:20:26	jwhitmore	Like I say it's my head. Up till now my home page has been what tied the various Django App's together in a central link to apps. Now my home page is moving to an App it's breaking the way I've worked. Like I say my head my problem I guess.
2015-04-08 04:20:36	kezabelle	that's only sort of true nowadays though, IIRC gunicorn has a automatic reloader option

2015-04-08 06:39:50	+MarkusH	you could add database level defaults (have a look at the RunSQL migration operation) and once 1.8.1 is out you add another RunSQL to drop the database level default and set default=timedelta(whatsoever) on the field
2015-04-08 06:40:01	+MarkusH	though Django won't respect the database level default
2015-04-08 06:40:25	+MarkusH	that way you'd ensure consistent data in the database though

How would I know to block out the second one, if I only want to allow this to happen once?

2015-04-08 20:25:09	mattmcc	It just tells the DB when you want to begin or commit (or rollback)

2015-04-08 20:27:19	Danathus	well presumably my webserver is handling two near-simultaneous http requests on two different threads, and both of these threads are touching the database, and I have a problem with a race condition whereby I check if it's safe to make a change, then make the change -- but in the meantime, the first thread has made its change making things no longer safe after the second thread does the test
2015-04-08 20:27:53	Danathus	and I need some way to wrap this up so only one thread will win, and the other thread won't make any changes
2015-04-08 20:27:56	FunkyBob	this iswhere DB-level locking wins
2015-04-08 20:28:03	mattmcc	Yeah, transactions don't actually address that use case.
2015-04-08 20:28:12	FunkyBob	combining transaction.atomic with select_for_update to affect a lock
2015-04-08 20:28:32	Danathus	hmm okay, I haven't worked with select_for_update yet
2015-04-08 20:28:55	Danathus	re: a lock, would I have to make an explicit table for this, or can I lock the database at large?
2015-04-08 20:29:12	FunkyBob	I just said... use those two to affect a lock
2015-04-08 20:29:37	FunkyBob	pick an object to lock on... select_for_update it... and tha [inside a transaction] will work as a lock

2015-04-08 20:32:39	Danathus	okay, so if I have this right: in a transaction.atomic() block, if I select_for_update(), then any changes made based on that query will be locked such that I will avoid executing the change twice on two threads
2015-04-08 20:33:05	Danathus	in your example what's the type of foo?
2015-04-08 20:34:23	Danathus	if I understand right, foo is an instance of MyModel...and the select_for_update() will block on the second thread, until the first thread is finished

2015-04-08 20:39:55	rhaps0dy	good skill to have
2015-04-08 20:39:55	Danathus	so far so good
2015-04-08 20:40:10	phix	rhaps0dy: depends on how you configured the email logger in your settings.py file
2015-04-08 20:40:12	rhaps0dy	did that ever happen to you?
2015-04-08 20:40:19	rhaps0dy	phix: I did not touch it, it's the default
2015-04-08 20:40:27	rhaps0dy	I set the  ADMINS setting to my email address
2015-04-08 20:40:28	phix	so maybe you want to modify it :)

2015-04-08 20:40:35	rhaps0dy	and it works, sometimes mails are sent
2015-04-08 20:40:42	phix	rhaps0dy: it only sends email on 500 errors, any others you need to configure it
2015-04-08 20:40:44	Danathus	no experience there I'm afraid, rhaps0dy
2015-04-08 20:40:49	rhaps0dy	phix: hum, isn't the default to send emails on 500 errors?
2015-04-08 20:40:52	rhaps0dy	phix: exactly
2015-04-08 20:41:01	rhaps0dy	there is a 500 reply, but I receive no email now
2015-04-08 20:41:20	rhaps0dy	so sometimes, on server replies with 500 error, there is a mail, and sometimes there isn't
2015-04-08 20:41:37	phix	rhaps0dy: but 500 errors that occur with your code, if the 500 error is being caused by wsgi or fastcgi giving up then you will need to look at your apache logs (assuming you're using apache)
2015-04-08 20:41:54	v0lksman	rhaps0dy: if the 500 is caused by the web server and not the django app you won't get an email
2015-04-08 20:42:01	phix	rhaps0dy: also if the error is caused by a syntax error it wont email you
2015-04-08 20:42:09	Danathus	interesting
2015-04-08 20:42:19	rhaps0dy	but emails are working perfectly
2015-04-08 20:42:20	mattmcc	v0lksman: In a shell, does this work?  'from django.utils.translation import get_language;print get_language()'
2015-04-08 20:42:25	phix	rhaps0dy: but it will log on your webserver

2015-04-08 20:42:33	rhaps0dy	phix, v0lksman
2015-04-08 20:42:45	rhaps0dy	I think that's the problem, you'er right
2015-04-08 20:42:51	rhaps0dy	it must be the web server
2015-04-08 20:42:51	phix	rhaps0dy: do you have access to your webserver? or is it hosted by someone?
2015-04-08 20:42:55	rhaps0dy	since the replies are empty
2015-04-08 20:42:59	rhaps0dy	it's hosted on Azure
2015-04-08 20:43:00	mattmcc	It'll log to your WSGI server.  Whether or not that makes it to the web server depends on your configuration.
2015-04-08 20:43:02	v0lksman	mattmcc: returns None
2015-04-08 20:43:03	rhaps0dy	but the logs are accessible
2015-04-08 20:43:11	mattmcc	v0lksman: Yeah, so that's your issue.

2015-04-08 20:43:48	phix	rhaps0dy: How is Azure?  I have only used Amazon and Rackspace.  I am still using the 1year free trial with Amazon so I have paid about $5USD for my hosting so far.
2015-04-08 20:43:51	rhaps0dy	it must be the server since the reply is empty, and django sends a big "500 error" header
2015-04-08 20:44:03	rhaps0dy	phix: I haven't used either Amazon or Rackspace so I can't compare
2015-04-08 20:44:07	rhaps0dy	but it's.. okay I guess

2015-04-08 21:55:41	mattmcc	The default auth backend should be able to handle it, yeah.
2015-04-08 21:55:51	Nizumzen	I'd change that pronto read this https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/passwords/

2015-04-08 21:56:08	mattmcc	Or you can write your own backend which re-saves the password with better hashing upon successful login.
2015-04-08 21:56:15	Nizumzen	m1yag1: use the 'django.contrib.auth.hashers.BCryptSHA256PasswordHasher' for best security
2015-04-08 21:57:05	m1yag1	ok, this would be a migration from another app to a new one. I would like users to still be able to login but then upon successful login for the django auth to take over.
2015-04-08 21:57:53	m1yag1	Nizumzen, essentially to take the previous hash or whatever (not sure exactly how it would work) and re-compute using the standard you suggest.
2015-04-08 21:58:35	mattmcc	https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/auth/passwords/#password-upgrading
2015-04-08 21:58:39	Nizumzen	m1yag1: if you add another password hasher to the PASSWORD_HASHERS setting then django will automatically upgrade the hash on next login
2015-04-08 21:58:48	m1yag1	mattmcc, I'll check that out thanks.
2015-04-08 21:59:12	m1yag1	Nizumzen, that is awesome. I'll do the research. I just need to be pointed in the right direction. Thanks guys.
2015-04-08 21:59:44	Nizumzen	no worries - just make sure to use bcrypt

2015-04-27 09:11:27	Hairy	adjust as in completely change the look and feel of the page / different pages / menu
2015-04-27 09:11:34	Hairy	or adjust as in update copy text
2015-04-27 09:11:38	Dominee	yes
2015-04-27 09:11:42	Dominee	just the content
2015-04-27 09:11:53	joshuajonah	smart, save people from themselves.
2015-04-27 09:11:54	Dominee	images and text
2015-04-27 09:12:07	Dominee	lol
2015-04-27 09:12:12	Hairy	then you could probably get away with something a little lighter than a CMS
2015-04-27 09:12:15	tbaxter	Dominee: ok, so you need some sort of basic articles/blog engine. What else?
2015-04-27 09:12:26	Dominee	just a company website
2015-04-27 09:12:39	Dominee	just information
2015-04-27 09:12:43	tbaxter	actually, so far you could do that much with flatpages, probably, but I’m guessing there’s more.
2015-04-27 09:12:46	Dominee	once it is done
2015-04-27 09:13:01	Hairy	so whats on the navbar?

2015-04-27 12:37:04	newdan	RyanMercury, django-admin.py gets installed to your system/virtualenv when you install django. It doesn't add any features, it will just keep you from having to write some boilerplate to use migrations
2015-04-27 12:37:30	bobbyr	I am selected these records based on a relation with another objects, and there are often many related objects returned in the queryset
2015-04-27 12:38:00	RyanMercury	okay, but wouldn't that require to have an 'INSTALLED_APPS' setting?
2015-04-27 12:38:17	bobbyr	sometimes multiple records will be returned for the same related object for the same date

2015-04-27 13:34:32	sgregory_ipc	How can i fix that//get around it so I can use UUIDs to represent the User/Group in Django?
2015-04-27 13:34:45	+carljm	dan00b_river: If you're not manipulating or storing this data on the server, and the APIs you are querying are public, I would move this code to the client.

2015-04-27 17:22:33	+MarkusH	if you have a model in an app that depends on django.contrib.auth.User but doesn't have migrations, Django wants to add a ForeignKey in yourapp_yourmodel to auth_user but can't because auth_user doesn't exist

2015-04-27 17:24:26	delgiudices	Thanks all will try all
2015-04-27 17:24:26	+MarkusH	when you use makemigrations to build the migrations for that app Django should add a dependency in the first migration on auth 0001_initial
2015-04-27 17:24:50	+MarkusH	cnk: because either migrated apps or unmigrated apps have to come first
2015-04-27 17:24:58	kenju254	MarkusH: My problem was not using the make migrations
2015-04-27 17:25:29	+MarkusH	since migrations are the only way to go in the future, you can just ship migrations for an app

2015-04-27 19:05:02	sleblanc	same question but in other words, is there a way to apply the same filtering construct (e.g. Q-objects) to both querysets and lists (or even single items) to maintain DRY? (I hope I won't get kicked for this), something similar to Linq and Linq to SQL in C#/.NET...
2015-04-27 19:07:22	knbk	sleblanc: please rephrase? I'm not exactly sure what you're getting at
2015-04-27 19:09:08	FunkyBob	sleblanc: there is a linq-alike lib for python
2015-04-27 19:09:23	FunkyBob	but... no...currently QuerySets are for constructing SQL queries
2015-04-27 19:09:42	FunkyBob	what's your real problem here?  what are you hoping to solve with this?
2015-04-27 19:09:58	sleblanc	So I have a model that inherits from a "PublishableMixin". The mixin adds "publication_date(dt)", "publication_end_date(dt)" and "is_published(bool)" fields to the model. I know how to build a `filter` construct to filter published items from unpublished items. Now I'd like to apply the same construct to a single object, so that its "is_published" method does not lead to code repeat (even worse than that, it's code repeat in a different "lang
2015-04-27 19:09:58	sleblanc	uage", so prone to errors)
2015-04-27 19:10:07	FunkyBob	sleblanc: stop writing walls of text
2015-04-27 19:10:10	FunkyBob	they're hard to read
2015-04-27 19:10:21	sleblanc	Do you want me to apologize?
2015-04-27 19:10:29	FunkyBob	no, I just want you to not do it again, please
2015-04-27 19:11:09	FunkyBob	so you want to avoid implementing the same logic in two places

2015-04-27 19:13:20	sleblanc	I dabbled in C# a few months ago and they have this somehow great feature (IMO) called Linq. It's a subset of SQL-like syntax built into the language, but with additional greatness:
2015-04-27 19:13:41	sleblanc	it works with both regular iterables and "database abstractions"
2015-04-27 19:13:43	FunkyBob	yeah, friend of mine raves about linq
2015-04-27 19:14:09	sleblanc	In my opinion, QuerySets and the Q interface could become Django's own Linq

2015-04-27 22:47:19	rajatkapoor	i looked up the solution online
2015-04-27 22:47:34	rajatkapoor	it asked to drop the adming log table and then do syncdb to create them again
2015-04-27 22:47:54	rajatkapoor	it dropped succesfully but didnt create it again
2015-04-27 22:48:14	FunkyBob	you're probably reading a doc for pre-1.7
2015-04-27 22:48:14	rajatkapoor	is there any way i can fix my stupidity
2015-04-27 22:48:31	FunkyBob	you need to fake migrate those tables back to null, and then apply migrations forward

2015-04-27 22:51:10	Back2Basics	I had unittest.testcase tests running.  I switched over the class inheritance to LiveServerTestCase then the tests stopped working.  It turns out the filename didn't like to be called sennium_tests.py but instead wanted to be called just tests.py before any test cases inside it ran?  Are there any broader rules for file naming conventions when using liveservertestcase?

2015-04-28 05:06:45	hydraidm801	I guess the example is just sudo code and not to be taken serious
2015-04-28 05:07:05	FunkyBob	do you mean "pseudo-code"?
2015-04-28 05:07:14	hydraidm801	uh yeah
2015-04-28 05:07:16	kezabelle	it's an example, yes, but there's nothing non-serious about it
2015-04-28 05:07:39	kezabelle	assuming whatever you feed that function implements .chunks(), it'd Just Work, insofar as writing to that file

2015-04-28 05:08:32	hydraidm801	I would guess 'destinations' is not a real keyword also
2015-04-28 05:08:59	kezabelle	of course it is, it's the file you just opened to write to

2015-04-28 05:09:42	FunkyBob	hydraidm801: using "with open...." just ensures the file is closed when you exit the with block

I want when  a column from the chart is clicked to be taken to a new page where I can see further info. My question is what is the best way to pass specific info of that column to its template?

2015-04-28 09:37:57	rasca	Hello everyone, I'm upgrading a project from 1.4 to 1.8, and I decided to take the route of upgrading 1.4 > 1.5 > 1.6 ... The this is that when installing django 1.5 I get the following error: `ImportError: cannot import name User` without a traceback. I think this is because django is finishing with a sys.exit instead of with an exception. Any ideas how to check where this sys.exit() is beeing called so I can debug and fix my code?

2015-04-28 12:41:02	+carljm	mekhami: For the very simplest case, there is no difference between a pytest fixture and just calling a function. But fixtures can do a lot more, e.g. teardown after the test runs, or class/module/session-scoped fixtures (where every test within the class/module/session gets the same returned fixture value, and the fixture runs only once), or fixtures depending on each other.

2015-04-28 12:41:20	mekhami	carljm that's what i'm seeing after continuing through the docs.
2015-04-28 12:41:26	mekhami	thanks for your answer :)

2015-04-28 12:43:31	knbk	ryanneufeld: it would be cleaner to error on makemigrations, but that's how it is
2015-04-28 12:43:42	moldy	ryanneufeld: deleting them from the filesystem and the database and creating a new initial one
2015-04-28 12:43:44	+carljm	it's really quite simple "magic", as magic goes: a registry of functions by name. The part about requesting them as function arguments isn't that different from e.g. @mock.patch on a class sending in extra parameters to all the class' methods.
2015-04-28 12:43:48	knbk	(which also reminds me that I should finish the patch for this)

2015-04-28 12:44:42	ryanneufeld	nice
2015-04-28 12:44:54	ryanneufeld	so, given where I am, how can I fix?
2015-04-28 12:45:11	mekhami	they already told you how you can fix it.
2015-04-28 12:45:25	knbk	see the description in https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/23034
2015-04-28 12:45:36	knbk	or rewrite your migrations so that you don't have to change it

2015-04-28 12:47:02	knbk	then remove the AlterField one

2015-04-28 15:03:54	peterc123	Boogymanx: best to do it in a view, but if your app is super javascript heavy, then you’ll probably want to do some checking there *also* (and that would technically be in your javascript when ajax requests come back with a logged-out error of sorts)
2015-04-28 15:04:30	Boogymanx	all right, thanks :) if I add that, what other logic do I need for the redirect? Just a if !user.authenticated() redirect()?

It seems built for actual different databases, not different users of the same database.

2015-04-28 15:54:52	tbaxter	May be possible to subclass get_object and do it there, but it sounds dodgy to me.

2015-05-10 19:18:44	FunkyBob	all Models have 3 permissions by default -- add, edit, delete
2015-05-10 19:18:52	FunkyBob	just put those permissions in the Group
2015-05-10 19:19:10	FunkyBob	just fire it up and go look
2015-05-10 19:20:36	doebi	got it. thx
2015-05-10 19:22:41	vascop	FunkyBob: So, sorry I misstyped that. So when using debug = False, I get bad requests if the requests come from the outside (localhost works though), but allowed_hosts is set to *. Do you have any ideas on what it might be?

2015-05-10 20:30:35	mcspud	knbk, FunkyBob: Thanks - the issue was that I did call an is_valid method on the form object , so that has successfully suppressed the error.  Here is the code http://pastebin.com/DuqsefWw (the update is still failing epicly though)
2015-05-10 20:31:28	mcspud	knbk, FunkyBob: Also, if anyone can direct me to documentation outlining the best way to use a unique value in a URL to route a redirect that'd be awsome (at the moment I'm doing it with Javascript which doesn't feel right)
2015-05-10 20:31:32	FunkyBob	why aren't you using the form view pattern as shown in the docs?
2015-05-10 20:33:22	mcspud	FunkyBob - I'd never touched python nor django until 2 days ago when i went through Test Driven Development with Python
2015-05-10 20:33:25	mcspud	Maybe I've missed something

2015-05-10 23:37:28	FunkyBob	if it doesn't need anything from the DB, sure
2015-05-10 23:37:38	Guddu	My use case is a inital configuration screen which should be shown even before the user has done the settings.py database config.
2015-05-10 23:37:44	FunkyBob	templates and the ORM are optional extras... helpers

2015-05-10 23:38:57	Guddu	FunkyBob, Thanks for your response. So that view can still render a template using Standard Template Mechanism?
2015-05-10 23:39:14	mattmcc	A view returns a response object, it doesn't even have to render a template.
2015-05-10 23:40:00	Guddu	mattmcc, I need to render a form though
2015-05-10 23:40:26	FunkyBob	so render a form
2015-05-10 23:40:38	FunkyBob	what do you mean by "Standard Template Mechanism"?
2015-05-10 23:40:58	FunkyBob	your view can use templates, or not... it can use the ORM... or not... its up to you
2015-05-10 23:41:08	Guddu	FunkyBob, To render a form i need to render a template right?
2015-05-10 23:42:20	FunkyBob	that's probably the easiest way, sure
2015-05-10 23:42:59	Guddu	FunkyBob, What other way there is?

2015-05-11 00:12:07	FunkyBob	vertexclique: if you're using a class-based view, you are almost certainly using a TemplateResponse, so you can test the context values from there
2015-05-11 00:12:13	FunkyBob	also the testing docs show you how to do exactly what you're asking

2015-05-11 01:58:53	astroduck	Hi, I am using a custom User model and I am making a signup form, in the view how do I get the user model, and create its object? I read somewhere that to get user model I should use get_user_model(), so should I do get_user_model()()?

2015-05-11 02:00:43	FunkyBob	astroduck: get_user_model returns the model class... so you can call objects.create_user on that...
2015-05-11 02:01:07	FunkyBob	of course, if you're using a GCBV, it can be even simpler

2015-05-11 02:20:55	kezabelle	get_user_model is more useful if you can see the model changing at some point (the most logical use-case: re-using the application in a different project, with a different user class)

2015-05-13 23:41:11	+jarshwah	did you add the `default_app_config` part to app/__init__.py ?
2015-05-13 23:41:16	FunkyBob	otrenav: create an AppConfig for your app... tell Django to use it
2015-05-13 23:43:39	otrenav	jarshwah, I did. But it's giving error regarding the non existence of apps.
2015-05-13 23:43:44	otrenav	FunkyBob, I tried that.
2015-05-13 23:43:59	+jarshwah	otrenav: which error? can you dpaste it please?
2015-05-13 23:44:19	FunkyBob	otrenav: need more details on what you did to try that...
2015-05-13 23:44:24	otrenav	Does it have to do with the fact that I have all my applications inside a folder named "apps"? Does that mess up all the imports statements? I've tried to fix it and it worked before I tried to change the name.
2015-05-13 23:44:41	otrenav	Yes, I'll do that. Thanks. Give me one sec.
2015-05-13 23:44:50	+jarshwah	what have you got added to INSTALLED_APPS ? is it "apps.MyApp" ?
2015-05-13 23:47:12	FunkyBob	otrenav: it doesn't mess anything up so long as your import statements are valid
2015-05-13 23:47:27	otrenav	I'm getting this

2015-05-13 23:48:17	otrenav	jarshwah, yes... I have "apps.MyApp" in the INSTALLED_APPS.
2015-05-13 23:48:30	+jarshwah	otrenav: if you have "apps.MyApp" added to INSTALLED_APPS, then you need default_app_config = "apps.MyApp.apps.MyAppConfig"
2015-05-13 23:49:13	+jarshwah	suggestion, don't put apps inside an apps directory.. it doesn't give you too much benefit, and you need to fiddle with imports
2015-05-13 23:49:48	+jarshwah	I used to do it that way too, but I don't anymore

2015-05-13 23:53:13	+jarshwah	that just means you're making your own personal applications segregated.. no real reason to do that

2015-05-19 12:19:10	Katharsis	if I use django + rosetta on uWSGI, how to configure rosetta for auto reload?
2015-05-19 12:19:29	moldy	kandinski: the data is on the *request* object. then the data is passed to the form when initializing it, thus creating a form that is "bound" to that data
2015-05-19 12:19:59	kandinski	but forms are empty to begin with
2015-05-19 12:20:03	kandinski	or assume mine is
2015-05-19 12:20:11	moldy	kandinski: unbound forms have no data. bound forms have data.
2015-05-19 12:20:15	kandinski	then I render an empty form, user fills it in, hits "send"
2015-05-19 12:20:28	kandinski	ah, "send" bounds the data to the form
2015-05-19 12:20:31	moldy	kandinski: a html form and a django form are related, but they are not the same thing
2015-05-19 12:20:45	kandinski	(django receives the response object and bounds the data to the form)

2015-05-19 12:24:36	moldy	you're welcome. why do you want to re-trigger validation?
2015-05-19 12:24:56	kandinski	it's tricky. I'm not using django the way it was designed.
2015-05-19 12:25:05	kandinski	We have users uploading CSV files.
2015-05-19 12:25:11	>	the_rat has joined #django
2015-05-19 12:25:14	tbaxter	so?
2015-05-19 12:25:20	kandinski	I was planning to use django models and modelforms to validate those CSVs
2015-05-19 12:25:24	moldy	so far, that does not go against the design of django :)
2015-05-19 12:25:33	tbaxter	OK
2015-05-19 12:25:41	kandinski	but each row in the CSV file would be a form/model instance.
2015-05-19 12:25:41	tbaxter	nothing strange here
2015-05-19 12:25:59	tbaxter	getting more interesting
2015-05-19 12:26:12	moldy	kandinski: do you really need forms here?
2015-05-19 12:26:14	kandinski	not coming from an http request, but from iterating through a series of CSV files in a zipfile.
2015-05-19 12:26:18	tbaxter	So, esssentially you have an import script
2015-05-19 12:26:44	kandinski	moldy: are you suggesting doing all validation in the model? That could work. But localflavors has the validation in the forms.
2015-05-19 12:26:50	moldy	kandinski: i have done the same a few times, but i think i have never used forms for that.
2015-05-19 12:26:53	kandinski	I was hoping to piggyback on that work.

2015-05-19 12:28:03	>	brockhaywood has joined #django
2015-05-19 12:28:07	moldy	kandinski: so if you get an invalid zip code somewhere in the CSV data, you need to display a useful error message?

2015-05-19 12:28:25	kandinski	moldy: and a lot of it is quite custom: field x has to be positive, another has to be in a range.

2015-05-19 12:28:58	kandinski	well, I was planning to instance a form per row, pick up all the errors, and then give a list of rows with errors (in fact, this is in the requirements)
2015-05-19 12:29:10	kandinski	we are automating an existing workflow that is now done manually
2015-05-19 12:29:13	moldy	kandinski: ok. that should work.
2015-05-19 12:29:31	moldy	kandinski: but why do you need to validate any form more than once?
2015-05-19 12:29:38	kandinski	but I'm 100% (or 99%) new to Django, so...
2015-05-19 12:29:48	kandinski	moldy: ah, this is in my experiments with django shell
2015-05-19 12:30:03	kandinski	I am instancing the form from a model, and I can't validate it apparently.
2015-05-19 12:30:05	moldy	kandinski: just create another form with the same data

2015-05-19 12:31:59	tbaxter	what do you expect to happen? What feedback do you want to provide? Technical implementation aside, how do you see this working?
2015-05-19 12:32:11	<	underthehill ha salido (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2015-05-19 12:32:13	kandinski	then build a django-$client_flavor library of custom forms and model validators.
2015-05-19 12:32:39	moldy	should work, yes
2015-05-19 12:32:45	kandinski	tbaxter: the requirements are as follows: clients of the site upload zipfiles full of CSV files that represent a database dump
2015-05-19 12:33:02	kandinski	we import all good records, give them errors for all the wrong rows
2015-05-19 12:33:07	moldy	maybe also take a look at drf's serializers
2015-05-19 12:33:44	kandinski	then they can resubmit everything, and the corrected records will be picked up
2015-05-19 12:33:47	moldy	but forms/modelforms are also able to do this. afaik, they are not bound to the http layer in any way.
2015-05-19 12:33:50	eka	kandinski: late to the talk ... but you need just one form for the filename to upload and in the backend you unzip that and process the file
2015-05-19 12:33:53	kandinski	it's low traffic, low volume of users
2015-05-19 12:33:59	eka	kandinski: did that some time ago
2015-05-19 12:34:12	kandinski	eka: yes, two levels of forms
2015-05-19 12:34:18	moldy	eka: his idea is to use one form per row in the csv :)
2015-05-19 12:34:18	kandinski	one form for the zipfile for sure
2015-05-19 12:34:27	moldy	eka: one django form, that is
2015-05-19 12:34:41	kandinski	but the models are per csv file, and the model instances are per row of the csv

2015-05-19 12:34:53	eka	kandinski: you don't need a form per csv line...
2015-05-19 12:35:01	kandinski	a form instance
2015-05-19 12:35:05	eka	kandinski: no
2015-05-19 12:35:08	moldy	eka: he *wants* one, to re-use code.
2015-05-19 12:35:08	kandinski	because I need to validate them independently
2015-05-19 12:35:29	kandinski	each row has complex rules
2015-05-19 12:35:34	tbaxter	kandinski: but what sort of feedback can you give? “Line 42 of your big csv was invalid?”
2015-05-19 12:35:39	eka	kandinski: use the model to validate... if the model explodes on objects.create... then you have your validation ;)
2015-05-19 12:35:44	>	micah_chatt has joined #django
2015-05-19 12:36:03	kandinski	tbaxter: ID XXX of YYY table is malformed: Error description.
2015-05-19 12:36:03	tbaxter	agree with eka. Set up the model correctly, then either explode or ignore.
2015-05-19 12:36:06	>	dominee has joined #django
2015-05-19 12:36:09	eka	kandinski: I did all that... without forms... used some structures to check for that before creating the model instance
2015-05-19 12:36:26	moldy	eka: then you miss out on stuff that forms provide. why not use forms? what is the drawback?
2015-05-19 12:36:28	mlavin	some structures like....a form!
2015-05-19 12:36:34	kandinski	eka: the structures exist, they are called validators in forms!
2015-05-19 12:36:48	tbaxter	Also the usual import script issues; Ensure object doesn’t already exist, that sort of thing.
2015-05-19 12:36:50	kandinski	I will use the existing validators in localflavors, then write my own $clientflavor
2015-05-19 12:37:16	moldy	kandinski: yup. i see nothing wrong with the plan so far.
2015-05-19 12:37:19	kandinski	tbaxter: we are happy clobbering existing objects with new data. They are allowed to correct stuff.
2015-05-19 12:37:32	tbaxter	kandinski: I think what eka is getting at is that there is a lot of built in validation at the model level you could be leveraging.
2015-05-19 12:37:38	kandinski	moldy: thanks. And thanks for the pointer to DRF, which is obvious that we can use.

2015-05-19 12:39:36	kandinski	tbaxter: that's possible, as I say, that I don't understand it. But localflavors validate fields in forms, not in models.

2015-05-19 12:59:36	eka	Katharsis: so, we came to the conclusion that you need to send a signal to uWSGI right? so you can go about making a special admin section with a button for reloading it manually, or make a django management command to do it ... and you can trigger that manually in the shell or with any tool like fabric, salt, etc...

How do I prevent Player() from saving with the attribute striker=True, when more than two other players are already strikers?

2015-05-19 14:44:57	RobOakes	Good morning. I've got kind of a strange problem with the Django ORM that I need some help with. I am using the ORM with Celery. I have a background task which takes a model instance and then creates a searchable version in ElasticSearch.
2015-05-19 14:45:13	RobOakes	The problem is that the background task frequently gets a stale version of the model data.
2015-05-19 14:45:20	RobOakes	It seems to be due to database lag.
2015-05-19 14:45:48	RobOakes	If I use a delay (time.sleep or similar), then the transaction has time to finish and I get valid data.
2015-05-19 14:45:57	mlavin	RobOakes: how are you passing the model data to the task?
2015-05-19 14:46:04	>	Goopyo has joined #django
2015-05-19 14:46:08	sudomarize	right i've installed venvwrapper and django (for python3/pip3), but i can't import it when running shell
2015-05-19 14:46:15	sudomarize	have a missed something?
2015-05-19 14:46:31	RobOakes	I'm just passing the primary key as an argument: task.delay(instance.pk).
2015-05-19 14:46:34	telling	sudomarize: have you activated your environment?
2015-05-19 14:46:38	sudomarize	pip3 install django worked, i can access django-admin, but can't import

2015-05-19 16:13:15	targetron	but where is that data “saved”?
2015-05-19 16:13:19	targetron	In a column somewhere?

2015-05-19 16:17:13	targetron	I think we may be talking about different things
2015-05-19 16:17:16	tbaxter	targetron: what do you want to do with this textbox that’s not part of the model?
2015-05-19 16:17:20	>	Genitrust has joined #django
2015-05-19 16:17:22	targetron	I’m talking about the admin page where you edit a single entry
2015-05-19 16:17:43	targetron	It shows textboxes / checkboxes to edit all the model attributes
2015-05-19 16:17:52	tbaxter	yes, and what do you want to do with this textbox that’s not part of the model?
2015-05-19 16:17:54	targetron	However, I want to add an extra textbox in there, for “comments"
2015-05-19 16:18:12	targetron	@tbaxter for “Comments”. So whenever someone edits something, they can leave a little comment in there for the next person
2015-05-19 16:18:12	>	yelrae has joined #django
2015-05-19 16:18:16	tbaxter	Ok, and when you click ‘save’, what should happen to these “comments”
2015-05-19 16:18:24	targetron	Nothing. It should just appear in the admin
2015-05-19 16:18:30	targetron	the next time someone edits the entry
2015-05-19 16:18:33	tbaxter	It has to be saved to appear anywhere.
2015-05-19 16:18:40	tbaxter	This is what you want:

2015-05-19 16:19:36	targetron	It doesn’t make “sense” to put it as part of the model
2015-05-19 16:19:37	tbaxter	you have to save the comment, right?
2015-05-19 16:19:42	targetron	Ya..

2015-05-19 16:27:33	sudomarize	tbaxter: so i need to configure settings.py to get django to search for mysite/templates/someapp_templates?

2015-05-19 17:42:59	gtarnoff	I've inherited a django app and I'm getting errors around syncdb - 'relation "django_content_type" does not exist' and I can't find anything that helps me fix this. Anyone know where I could look?

2015-05-19 17:46:31	RasJam_	I upgraded an app at the same time I upgraded to 1.7. I forgot to run the most recent south migrations for that app in between versions. The django migration was marked as fake, since some of the tables already existed.
2015-05-19 17:46:43	<	bee_keeper ha salido (Quit: Lost terminal)
2015-05-19 17:46:55	RasJam_	so I'm essentially missing a few tables for that app, and the old migrations. How can I fix this?
2015-05-19 17:47:52	<	d8 ha abandonado #django
2015-05-19 17:47:57	RasJam_	the first and second django migration were marked as fake, but the second one contained all the migrations I hadn't run, plus the ones I had run
2015-05-19 17:48:49	RasJam_	theres a non reversible django migration too, so I can't go back to 0001 then go back to south I think

2015-05-19 19:28:49	rray	i had a question
2015-05-19 19:28:59	rray	how do i add additional fields in my custom modelserializer?
2015-05-19 19:29:00	<	targetron ha salido (Quit: targetron)
2015-05-19 19:29:06	rray	like i'm writing a modelserializer
2015-05-19 19:29:21	rray	but i want some fields that represent the request variables that i accept
2015-05-19 19:29:27	rray	but they don't translate to model fields
2015-05-19 19:29:38	rray	should i still inherit modelserializer or write it myself entirely?
2015-05-19 19:29:47	FunkyBob	I take it we're to assume this is a DRF question?

2015-05-26 09:08:17	autrilla	I find client side magic ok as long as you don't do client side rendering
2015-05-26 09:08:37	FunkyBob	there are cases for and against
2015-05-26 09:08:45	autrilla	It can get too heavy, and people use phones and stuff
2015-05-26 09:09:23	FunkyBob	autrilla: Kogan's mobile site is statically served, and works entirely off the APIs
2015-05-26 09:09:34	FunkyBob	so it's pretty much entirely client-side rendering

2015-05-26 09:16:21	sudomarize	FunkyBob: django-nap looks pretty cool, im curious why you wrote a rest framework from the ground up rather than using the incumbant (DRF). What were the deciding factors?
2015-05-26 09:16:23	maugzoide	FunkyBob:  yep, South! I am not able to migrate to Django 1.8 right now, sorry. I will check for what Freeze means.
2015-05-26 09:16:54	newke	oh. thanks. that had to be obvious
2015-05-26 09:17:08	kezabelle	maugzoide: it'll include the app definition for another app inside the migration, such that you can do orm['otherapp.OtherModel']
2015-05-26 09:17:32	FunkyBob	sudomarize: DRF wasn't incumbent when I wrote that

2015-05-26 09:18:31	FunkyBob	sudomarize: TP was too slow and clumsy, and had some major design flaws -- not least was that serialiser and publisher were the same class
2015-05-26 09:18:59	FunkyBob	so I took some work on serialising I already had, re-polished a Publisher pattern I developed years ago... and crisco... nap was born
2015-05-26 09:19:10	moldy	inheriting from a custom user model without hardcoding it is not supported, right?
2015-05-26 09:19:10	FunkyBob	since then I've added DataMappers, CBV, and RPC views to it
2015-05-26 09:19:18	moldy	i have to use an explicit OneToOneField?
2015-05-26 09:19:35	eimsto	Hey people :) I have to filters in Django admin page. Both of them are filtering through reverse ForeignKey field values. The problem is, that when those both filters are used together, they create double INNER JOINs, which is very un-effective. How should I avoid that ?

2015-05-26 09:21:30	eimsto	yup
2015-05-26 09:21:47	FunkyBob	eimsto: the way to avoid that is to put both filters in the same call to filter()

2015-05-26 09:36:20	moldy	well, you can of course do it from python
2015-05-26 09:36:47	FunkyBob	it'll just consume a worker whilst serving it
2015-05-26 09:37:01	moldy	the stackoverflow post you linked to already contains the relevant information

2015-05-26 09:39:00	moldy	tyrolite: you simple generate a HttpResponse with the file contents and tell the browser to handle it as a file download by setting the appropriate headers
2015-05-26 09:39:05	beejoomboom	Hello! I have just started developing my first django project that is not following a tutorial and I have some questions

2015-05-26 09:39:44	beejoomboom	What is the best way of adding fields to the user, such as birthdate?
2015-05-26 09:39:48	moldy	tyrolite: if you do not read the file path from the user (or if you do, do not trust it), it is secure

2015-05-26 09:44:02	tyrolite	moldy, shouldn't wsgi protocol handle this sort of stuff? some django to server notification mechanism
2015-05-26 09:44:27	moldy	tyrolite: that would be xsendfile, but you don't want that since not every server supports it
2015-05-26 09:45:03	moldy	tyrolite: when you are setting the http headers using django, you are using wsgi to handle this stuff.
2015-05-26 09:45:57	beejoomboom	What is the best way to add a model that will be accessible throughout several apps?
2015-05-26 09:46:04	moldy	it is not possible to inherit from settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL, right?

2015-05-26 09:52:11	tyrolite	beejoomboom, you can add models in BASE_DIR/site_dir/models.py and then import them in your apps
2015-05-26 09:52:34	tyrolite	base_dir is where manage.py is located
2015-05-26 09:52:52	tyrolite	at least this is how I do it

2015-05-26 09:54:05	rando305	I'm in django admin.  I'm trying to delete a user.  It displays the related objects to be deleted (one of which is oddly not hot-linked) - then fails with error:  User matching query does not exist.  I'm assuming that it has something to do with the related object that it thinks is there - but perhaps is not.  (It's open source code - so I don't fully understand all the models ...yet).  any suggestions?

2015-05-26 09:58:53	rando305	tyrolite, I'm chasing the location of the models.  I'll look for that.  What would be the best way to find all the locations of the models referencing "user"?  From the database reverse keys?
2015-05-26 10:00:38	tyrolite	rando305, do you want to keep the user realted data after delete?
2015-05-26 10:00:57	tyrolite	rando305, or it should delete in cascade
2015-05-26 10:01:30	rando305	tyrolite, delete in cascade

2015-05-26 10:03:50	tyrolite	rando305, I'm not very familiar with Django's ORM but I have a stupid ideea of doing that version
2015-05-26 10:03:57	rando305	It's a bit strange because I have a development server and a production server - and the behavior is slightly different.  In development, it fails, I go back and the user is deleted.  In production, the user is not deleted (and therefore, there is no way to delete the user.)

2015-05-26 10:07:21	dardevelin	little brain dead here
2015-05-26 10:07:22	szacun	Hi! I have a simple model which contains foreign key to itself: https://dpaste.de/iDfn
2015-05-26 10:07:23	dardevelin	reading http://django-allauth.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html
2015-05-26 10:07:32	szacun	i want to rename this model: https://dpaste.de/rWcU
2015-05-26 10:07:35	dardevelin	and following the example on a brand new project just to understand things
2015-05-26 10:07:38	dardevelin	I see SITE_ID = 1
2015-05-26 10:07:41	szacun	when i ran makemigrations django correctly recognized this rename, and created migration: https://dpaste.de/5mz7
2015-05-26 10:07:45	szacun	unfortunetly when i run migrate the following error happens: https://dpaste.de/keyu I think this is because of this foregin key to itself
2015-05-26 10:07:50	dardevelin	later I see "Add a Site for your domain, matching settings.SITE_ID (django.contrib.sites app)."
