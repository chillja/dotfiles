2015-02-21 19:41:08	TheShadowZero	i can try gummiboot
2015-02-21 19:41:12	TheShadowZero	what am i looking for in fstab tho
2015-02-21 19:41:21	jdahm	Earnestly: ok ha I'll just wait then
2015-02-21 19:41:22	sudokode	gummiboot is so simple, it's awesome
2015-02-21 19:41:22	TheShadowZero	(it looks correct, i thinkn)

2015-02-21 19:41:27	TheShadowZero	ok
2015-02-21 19:41:29	sudokode	it's like syslinux for uefi
2015-02-21 19:41:34	TheShadowZero	then i'll try gummiboot
2015-02-21 19:41:40	ch_ris	sudokode same

2015-02-21 19:42:02	sudokode	TheShadowZero: no why would you do that
2015-02-21 19:42:10	sudokode	is /boot your ESP?
2015-02-21 19:42:10	jdahm	I installed on a macbook air and every time I go into OSX it seems like the bootloader goes back to the apple thing from gummiboot
2015-02-21 19:42:10	Serus	TheShadowZero: no need to, gummiboot will just install itself over it
2015-02-21 19:42:18	TheShadowZero	ok Serus 
2015-02-21 19:42:19	jdahm	any way to make it permanently gummiboot?

2015-02-21 19:44:46	sudokode	the windows boot manager which I'm guessing doesn't support solaris anymore
2015-02-21 19:44:48	sudokode	so sad
2015-02-21 19:44:53	Earnestly	Serus: Dijkstra essentially proved that testing was useless

2015-04-08 03:28:14	saivert	well what MS makes doesn't have to be a standard as it is primarily only used by MS and users of MS products. I'm not talking mentioning powershell and saying that should be implemented for linux. I'm using it as an example of something that has been implemented that works right now. The idea behind it is sound and just.

2015-04-08 21:49:36	matty_r	dacoit: Do I need to upgrade my kernel then to get to 3.19.3-3?
2015-04-08 21:50:57	dacoit	matty_r: -Syu upgrades all requires packages (including kernel) You can see if installed kernel doesn't match currently-loaded kernel by comparing `uname -r` and `pacman -Q linux`
2015-04-08 21:51:23	matty_r	dacoit: Yes, it's different
2015-04-08 21:51:46	matty_r	pacman -Q linux is linux 3.19-3-3. uname -r is 3.19.3-1-ARCH
2015-04-08 21:51:56	dacoit	matty_r: Then pacman upgraded your kernel to the version given by -Q So you should reboot when you get a chance
2015-04-08 21:52:14	matty_r	dacoit: i'll reboot now and check again
2015-04-08 21:52:58	matty_r	it's still only showing as 3-1
2015-04-08 21:53:15	dacoit	matty_r: It's good practice. Stuff breaks (usually harmless) when those dont match, as the installed modules arent compatible with the kernel in ram.

Which one is correct?

2015-04-28 14:51:48	seemikehack	Hey all, been having some problems with netctl-auto, just doing a sanity check before I disconnect and start messing around. 1) Profiles live in /etc/netctl, 2) I need to run netctl disable for any profiles I've ever connected to before, 3) I need to start and enable netctl-auto@<interface>.service, and 4) any extant profiles in /etc/netctl should be automatically enabled. Am I missing anything?

So let's see, the first two are the missing log file (that's because /media/original is not auto-mounted - that's what I was trying to set up. SO sick beard is trying to read the log file before Original is mounted.
2015-05-11 00:54:18	grawity	ah, yeah, there's more: 957) httpd won't start because /etc/httpd/modules/mod_authn_default.so is missing (note that /etc/httpd/modules is usually a symlink to /usr/lib/httpd/modules),

2015-05-11 00:56:41	TheoMurpse	in fact, I only changed the auto-mount options to include mounting with ACL in a non-root drive, which if not even plugged in, still the device won't let me SSH in.

2015-05-11 01:04:42	grawity	one or two might mean you need `sudo sha256sum` or you're just seeing edited config files (this doesn't care about config vs non-config), but ~7k is a serious problem

A good way is to show that you've done some investigation yourself and ask the question now and then if there's been a lot of activity.  Generally 10 or 20 minutes is an acceptable range
2015-05-19 13:03:57	grazzolini	Waldblau: my suggestion to you is to use udev persistent naming
2015-05-19 13:04:01	Waldblau	grazzolini: since I only have one wireless device it should always be named wlan0, shouldn't it?

Either way, you can probably get away with using kernel device naming (wlan[0-9]) but if you ever decide to attach a usb wireless key for example, it might get a bit tricky then

2015-05-19 13:19:44	Waldblau	Earnestly: Correct. It might be a BIOS problem, as grazzolini said, since there's some options for intel wifi in my bios, although my card is not an intel card. I'm googling this right now.

2015-05-19 16:29:15	sudokode	ah that doesn't imply it supports two freqs then
2015-05-19 16:29:16	AbrarSyed	I openned up my laptop to install an SSD recently. I have 2 antennas. One black and one white, coming from my network thingy
2015-05-19 16:29:18	sudokode	but it would be helpful
2015-05-19 16:29:40	grazzolini	AbrarSyed: probably one for wireless and other for bluetooth
2015-05-19 16:29:43	grazzolini	come on
2015-05-19 16:29:44	AbrarSyed	ive connected to 5GHZ stuff before.. idk if it can connect tio both at once

2015-05-19 16:30:01	grazzolini	AbrarSyed: you can't
2015-05-19 16:30:18	sudokode	grazzolini: apparently it's not uncommon for wifi and bluetooth to both run on one antenna

2015-05-19 16:31:56	sudokode	I love my bluetooth devices
2015-05-19 16:31:58	grazzolini	AbrarSyed: you can write a netctl hook
2015-05-19 16:32:12	sudokode	at least the headphones are the only ones I use near wifi
2015-05-19 16:32:18	sudokode	the other is an FM transmitter for my truck

2015-05-19 16:33:01	AbrarSyed	hmm, so it hits the frequency when it connects to that network huh.. definitely possible...  If im not mistaken, does netctl-auto automatically connect to known networks with the best connectivity? or does it just connect to the first one it sees?
2015-05-19 16:33:04	grazzolini	works at great distances... too bad you can only put 96Mhz on it
2015-05-19 16:33:26	sudokode	AM is better at a distance
2015-05-19 16:33:37	sudokode	but it's also easily distorted
2015-05-19 16:33:48	grazzolini	sudokode: but can pack less audio quality
2015-05-19 16:34:13	sudokode	but yeah, bluetooth to the phone, FM to the truck's radio

So basically if the service does not use EnvironmentFile, I have to modify the service, EnvironmentFile=-/etc/sysconfig/filename, and then pass the variable to ExecStart? Or there is another way without modifying the service? Also if I use EnvironmentFile, does that mean that defined variable could be used also inside the script called by the ExecStart, or I need to explicitely [...]

2015-05-19 17:30:35	A124	nogbit While reiserfs is old, and sadly because author was jailed it did not become bomb great, it still packs a punch for certain usecases. noatime, packing (multiple small files into single block, to increase space efficiency), or no packing, etc. ext4, reiserfs (the old one), and xfs are popular. I used the first two. What was your data that filled the inodes?
2015-05-19 17:31:19	nogbit	NodeJS filled the indoes....tons of dev dependancies on numerous projects etc.....lots of small files in the end

2015-05-19 19:16:20	yaomtc	sudokode: "ReplayGain is a proposed standard published by David Robinson in 2001 to measure the perceived loudness of audio in computer audio formats such as MP3 and Ogg Vorbis. It allows players to normalize loudness for individual tracks or albums. This avoids the common problem of having to manually adjust volume levels between tracks when playing audio files from albums that have been mastered at different loudness levels."

2015-05-19 19:33:30	Halfwit	Those old men said, "Yeah! Sounds good!" and then, then they turned down the hearing aids.
2015-05-19 19:33:31	BrainDamage	while matching the recording to the FSR would result in apparent perceiced loudness ( since you're using dyn range until the MSB, therefore raising the rms ), it doesn't imply that dyn range compression was implied
2015-05-19 19:33:37	yaomtc	do you guys have an article you can show me on this cause I'm interested in reading about it

2015-05-26 09:57:08	BrainDamage	well, generally the maintainer itself cares at least a bit about a package
2015-05-26 09:57:23	polyzen	especially when they have 2k packages
2015-05-26 09:57:38	BrainDamage	also packages can be dropped out if nobody cba to maintain it

2015-05-26 10:00:43	P67	Hi All.. I'm suffering somesort of weirdness on my Arch laptop. GDM seems to be started on both VTY1 (ctrl-alt-f1) and VTY3 (ctrl-alt-f3). GDM binaries are also both running as x and wayland, and both as gdm and root..

2015-05-26 10:03:03	sudokode	everyone's probably just gonna ask you why you're using gdm
2015-05-26 10:03:19	sudokode	apparently there are a lot of these useless things called display managers
2015-05-26 10:03:26	keenerd	Earnestly: I emailed the OSW guy, we'll see what is up.
2015-05-26 10:03:50	polyzen	sudokode, found a bit of a peeve the other day. i have my system set to autologin and automatically run startx
