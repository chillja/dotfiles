2015-01-25 17:44:20	hulahulahest	Well, I disagree that it's not better - the latter image is far better in my eyes.
2015-01-25 17:44:27	hulahulahest	But that's not really important, what I think about that picture.
2015-01-25 17:44:32	drnick	Sk3letor, you may like it more, but the second is not objectively superior
2015-01-25 17:44:38	hulahulahest	Just be cautious about dismissing people just because they don't like what you like.
2015-01-25 17:44:43	drnick	the second image is boring
2015-01-25 17:44:52	drnick	I could just take a camera and take a photo that would be the same
2015-01-25 17:44:55	hulahulahest	And definitely don't angrily shout that people "don't get art" just because they don't like what you like. That's arrogant and shitty.
2015-01-25 17:45:04	Sk3letor	drnick: still I would say laziness if you would support that pixel one than this painting
2015-01-25 17:45:04	drnick	the first one really used the medium (painting) to the best
2015-01-25 17:45:15	ReactorScram	Sk3letor: anyway that is not what I meant by fixing
2015-01-25 17:45:43	Sk3letor	ReactorScram: oh, nvm then :D
2015-01-25 17:45:54	drnick	Sk3letor, wzl's pixel art isn't even finished, nor is he getting his everyday bread through his pixel art (I think) unlike the artists that made these paintings
2015-01-25 17:45:58	hulahulahest	Well, I don't really agree. The latter picture shows great technical skill and attention to detail.
2015-01-25 17:46:17	hulahulahest	The first is okay, sure, but... smears don't impress me.
2015-01-25 17:46:24	hulahulahest	But it's certainly not bad.
2015-01-25 17:47:36	Sk3letor	drnick: finished or not but he just said that he gonna use less colors what means more like into that what it looks now.

2015-01-25 17:48:20	drnick	Sk3letor, using less colors isn't lazyness nor it makes the resulting art inferior
2015-01-25 17:48:47	Sk3letor	im not saying now that less color is lazyness but if style will be that what it looks now, then I would say lazy.

2015-01-25 17:50:36	drnick	I am going to finish with a personal attack, the lazy person here is you Sk3letor considering your resisteance to learning to program that has been extensively established
2015-01-25 17:50:54	Sk3letor	drnick: oh please, like you do everything alone.
2015-01-25 17:51:00	drnick	despite wanting to do things that require just that
2015-01-25 17:51:16	gingerale	Ooh, to detect gamepad support all you have to do is  return "getGamepads" in navigator;  for your checker function.
2015-01-25 17:53:08	Sk3letor	hmm, is there free pixel painter softwares?

2015-01-25 18:00:19	awsumpwner27	"La Nona Ora" or "The Ninth Hour"
2015-01-25 18:01:07	hulahulahest	Yep, that's the pope getting hit by a meteor all right.
2015-01-25 18:01:25	awsumpwner27	It's a life-sized sculpture of Pope John Paul II getting hit with a space rock.

2015-01-25 18:04:05	gallefray	What's the name of this thing
2015-01-25 18:04:08	gallefray	Like, 
2015-01-25 18:04:16	gallefray	hm
2015-01-25 18:04:34	gallefray	a persistent variable that's bound to a function
2015-01-25 18:04:44	ReactorScram	Like in a closure?
2015-01-25 18:04:54	Nimphious	gallefray: Static?
2015-01-25 18:04:56	hulahulahest	Local?
2015-01-25 18:04:58	gallefray	Aaaah, I was spelling it "Clojure" and kept on getting the language
2015-01-25 18:05:05	ReactorScram	yeah that'll do it
2015-01-25 18:05:18	awsumpwner27	It's static.
2015-01-25 18:05:26	gallefray	yeah
2015-01-25 18:05:36	ReactorScram	Okay I now have a list of all the duplicate vertices in the mesh
2015-01-25 18:05:40	gallefray	Thanks!
2015-01-25 18:05:47	gallefray	awsumpwner27: Ah, yeah I've seen people do that as well
2015-01-25 18:05:53	gallefray	now to test
2015-01-25 18:05:56	ReactorScram	Which I got with the crafty secret that x == x really can be used to compare floats
2015-01-25 18:06:12	awsumpwner27	ReactorScram, :O
2015-01-25 18:06:35	 *	gallefray sharp intake of breath
2015-01-25 18:06:40	ReactorScram	Now I want to fix up the normals on these but I'm not sure how
2015-01-25 18:07:26	ReactorScram	If I could have Blender add metadata to a vertex telling how to smooth it, that would help
2015-01-25 18:08:19	hulahulahest	Can't you just average them?
2015-01-25 18:08:26	ReactorScram	Yeah but I want some of them to stay sharp
2015-01-25 18:08:37	hulahulahest	Well, usually it's up to the artists to take care of that
2015-01-25 18:08:43	ReactorScram	Like if you're looking at a cylinder, I want the round part to be smooth but the end caps to be flat
2015-01-25 18:08:44	hulahulahest	Merge vertices that need to be smooth, keep duped the ones that shouldn't
2015-01-25 18:09:00	ReactorScram	Unfortunately Blender screws up my UV coords if I merge any vertices at all
2015-01-25 18:09:06	ReactorScram	I wonder how other engines handle this
2015-01-25 18:09:15	hulahulahest	Well, like I said, they don't usually...
2015-01-25 18:09:21	hulahulahest	Duplicate vertices in models are usually interpreted as intentional
2015-01-25 18:09:28	hulahulahest	And the art team makes sure the model is correct and as intended
2015-01-25 18:09:32	awsumpwner27	To calculate the normal a vertex, you have to perform a cross product between all adjacent pairs of edges and average them.
2015-01-25 18:09:54	gallefray	if I init a variable like so `static int eek = 1;`, then I do `printf("%d", eek += 3);` would, in the next invocation of the function, eek be 4 or 1.
2015-01-25 18:09:55	hulahulahest	awsumpwner27, he already has normals though

2015-01-25 18:10:00	awsumpwner27	good
2015-01-25 18:10:05	gallefray	I'm guessing 4, but...
2015-01-25 18:10:10	gallefray	*1
2015-01-25 18:10:17	gallefray	I'm guessing 1, but...
2015-01-25 18:10:25	hulahulahest	It will print 4 and then 7, I think?
2015-01-25 18:10:36	awsumpwner27	4 7 10 13 16
2015-01-25 18:10:39	hulahulahest	And it'll be 4 at the start of the next invocation
2015-01-25 18:10:40	ReactorScram	Yeah I want to average them and then normalize, and that's easy, I just don't know which ones to average and which ones to ignore
2015-01-25 18:10:53	gallefray	ah
2015-01-25 18:11:07	gallefray	I figured that it might reassign it to one
2015-01-25 18:11:10	hulahulahest	Assuming this is C
2015-01-25 18:11:33	hulahulahest	Nope.
2015-01-25 18:11:35	gallefray	Your assumption is correct
2015-01-25 18:11:41	hulahulahest	Static things are... well, they're written into the binary image
2015-01-25 18:11:46	gallefray	Aaaah
2015-01-25 18:11:48	hulahulahest	And their constructors are run if they have them on program startup
2015-01-25 18:11:54	hulahulahest	But the number "1" is just in your binary somewhere.
2015-01-25 18:12:04	awsumpwner27	There's only one instance of them in memory, and they're not exactly on the stack, iirc.
2015-01-25 18:12:09	ReactorScram	Smoothing is supposed to be per-edge, right? I could generate a list of edges somehow
2015-01-25 18:12:11	gallefray	That makes sense
2015-01-25 18:12:18	hulahulahest	They're in the data segment

2015-01-25 18:14:57	gallefray	Just wondering mainly
2015-01-25 18:15:03	hulahulahest	All right
2015-01-25 18:15:12	hulahulahest	This is still assuming C/C++ btw

2015-01-25 18:15:36	hulahulahest	But not for anything interesting
2015-01-25 18:15:49	hulahulahest	We did one in school for a project
2015-01-25 18:15:52	hulahulahest	It was called Leeloo
2015-01-25 18:15:57	hulahulahest	Because it was a multipass compiler
2015-01-25 18:16:15	gallefray	I wrote a compiler, it was awful. Then I wrote a tokenizer lib in lua, but depression struck me before I moved on to the parser lib

2015-01-25 19:07:10	drnick	it happens that it otherwise becomes complicated to map an enum to an array

2015-01-25 19:07:34	gallefray	Ehh

2015-01-25 19:08:22	gallefray	oldtopman: from what I've read it can be used as the multiplication operator, that only applies if you're doing matrix multiplication
2015-01-25 19:08:25	gallefray	drnick: yeah
2015-01-25 19:08:27	drnick	in all cases, it seems she was being pedantic and annoying
2015-01-25 19:08:35	drnick	this seems to be an issue of notation
2015-01-25 19:08:41	gallefray	that's what I thought
2015-01-25 19:08:48	hulahulahest	I'm confused

2015-01-25 19:09:48	gallefray	x⋅y
2015-01-25 19:10:07	gallefray	whereas the maths tutor wanted xy
2015-01-25 19:10:14	drnick	unless it has explicit standards
2015-01-25 19:10:16	iFire	this is important in vector maths
2015-01-25 19:10:19	drnick	does it
2015-01-25 19:10:22	iFire	because order is important 
2015-01-25 19:10:42	gallefray	they weren't matrices so it's ?commutative?
2015-01-25 19:10:48	drnick	"xy" being allowed for example reduces you to single letter variables
2015-01-25 19:10:59	hulahulahest	"xy" is ambiguous in the case of vectors, mind
2015-01-25 19:11:07	hulahulahest	Well, in maths, you usually only use single letter variables
2015-01-25 19:11:13	hulahulahest	With subscripts if necessary
2015-01-25 19:11:15	drnick	for some reason

2015-01-25 19:13:08	drnick	scientific code is much more sensitive than most programming
2015-01-25 19:13:24	drnick	it has enourmous cost to run and the result must be guaranteed to be right

2015-01-25 19:13:30	hulahulahest	I'm going to have to disagree with you on the basic premise there.
2015-01-25 19:13:44	drnick	so therefore they should be using even better practices
2015-01-25 19:13:55	drnick	yet, FORTRAN.
2015-01-25 19:14:10	hulahulahest	Yeah, fortran is from the 1950s.
2015-01-25 19:14:42	hulahulahest	Funny though, some fortran code remains relevant in 2015..
2015-01-25 19:14:54	hulahulahest	(e.g. LAPACK)
2015-01-25 19:15:28	drnick	there is some cutting-edge simulation of human brains being done at huge costs, and a significant portion of it is old FORTRAN code
2015-01-25 19:16:20	iostream	> cutting-edge
2015-01-25 19:16:26	iostream	> FORTRAN
2015-01-25 19:16:31	drnick	yes
2015-01-25 19:16:47	hulahulahest	Well that's the thing, iostream, fortran remains binary compatible with C
2015-01-25 19:16:51	drnick	because academics like FORTRAN
2015-01-25 19:17:01	hulahulahest	So once you have a functioning, well-tested and proven package, why change it for no reason?
2015-01-25 19:17:04	hulahulahest	LAPACK just works.
2015-01-25 19:17:29	drnick	because it would be more mantainable, easier to understand, possibly faster?
2015-01-25 19:17:54	hulahulahest	It's finished though. It doesn't need maintenance.
2015-01-25 19:18:02	drnick	the latter depending on your capability to use more recent compilers and related
2015-01-25 19:18:04	hulahulahest	Easier to understand, yeah, the names in that thing are awful
2015-01-25 19:18:26	hulahulahest	But you've got to realize there's a MONSTROUS cost of switching to a new package.
2015-01-25 19:18:29	drnick	specifically in the brains thing I mentioned the neuron simulation code is in FORTRAN
2015-01-25 19:18:42	hulahulahest	Some vague promise that "it'll possibly be faster?" is a laughable proposition. You need more than that.
2015-01-25 19:18:46	drnick	the cost here is finding someone who knows C well and neurons well at the same time
2015-01-25 19:18:59	drnick	hulahulahest, the other points are much stronger yes
2015-01-25 19:19:19	drnick	LAPACK likely has alternatives, I believe?
2015-01-25 19:19:35	hulahulahest	Not really?
2015-01-25 19:19:48	hulahulahest	BLAS and LAPACK are pretty much standard even today
2015-01-25 19:20:27	drnick	well, that is a significantly less relevant example than mine
2015-01-25 19:20:27	hulahulahest	Wikipedia tells me Intel has one replacement for BLAS called MKL
2015-01-25 19:20:33	drnick	Linear algebra won't change
2015-01-25 19:20:36	hulahulahest	Right
2015-01-25 19:20:38	drnick	our understanding of neurons will
2015-01-25 19:20:45	hulahulahest	That's why for some applications, people still use fortran
2015-01-25 19:20:51	hulahulahest	(e.g. linear algebra)
2015-01-25 19:21:08	drnick	but you don't need to use FORTRAN, just LAPACK
2015-01-25 19:21:16	drnick	there is a difference
2015-01-25 19:22:34	hulahulahest	Right, fortran is compatible with C.

2015-01-25 20:07:05	awsumpwner27	and I realized that it feeds you about as much information as a real elevator would be able to collect, and you must write a program to respond to it.

2015-01-25 20:07:53	DesertRock	big difference

2015-01-25 20:30:06	Jacob123	I think I prefer that over some sort of melee attack the player can do
2015-01-25 20:30:07	awsumpwner27	The story itself seemed silly to many, and the image itself made her look deranged, so naturally it became somewhat of a meme.
2015-01-25 20:30:20	DesertRock	Jacob123: I might consider either replacing that flower shader with a pixel animation, or make the animation a little more pixely.
2015-01-25 20:30:36	Jacob123	DesertRock: You think?
2015-01-25 20:30:53	awsumpwner27	I'm no one to question what was probably a doctor's diagnosis.
2015-01-25 20:31:36	DesertRock	Jacob123: Seems a bit too smooth when compared to the other sprites in the game
2015-01-25 20:31:47	Jacob123	DesertRock: I mean, this gif isn't the best quality, if you are on windows you can play the build from ld30
2015-01-25 20:31:53	DesertRock	Like everything is super pixely execpt for the flower
2015-01-25 20:32:18	DesertRock	Yar, not on windows. Just what I think, its more of an opinon thing
2015-01-25 20:32:19	awsumpwner27	Yeah, it clashes aesthetically.
2015-01-25 20:33:11	Jacob123	Wouldn't that help you to know that they are interactive though?
2015-01-25 20:34:18	awsumpwner27	Jacob123, well, it wouldn't be a problem if you placed them in such an environment when the player first saw them that they appeared to be the only thing to interact with.
2015-01-25 20:34:21	Jacob123	I mean, the system works and I got a lot of positive feedback on the shader during ld30
2015-01-25 20:35:18	Jacob123	I'll continue development and see how it goes, if it really turns people's nose up at it then I'll consider changing them
2015-01-25 20:37:40	Jacob123	I don't like how people look at art though and turn their nose up at things. I can make this game uber fun, but if people only judged it by the art then nobody will play it

2015-02-21 17:22:50	hulahulahest	That's... why I used std::move.
2015-02-21 17:23:08	drnick	BearishMushroom, add some PHP and have highscores
2015-02-21 17:23:20	hulahulahest	Does it want the operator, I wonder.

2015-02-21 18:00:43	ReactorScram	Plus then you have to process tons of demos

2015-04-05 18:36:07	ReactorScram	awsumpwner27: With normal kinematics, you find the end point by concatenating transforms down from the root bone
2015-04-05 18:36:25	ReactorScram	awsumpwner27: With inverse kinematics, you position the end point, and a function solves for the transforms up to the root
2015-04-05 18:37:16	BlackBird	oldtopman: is that something you have a use for or just suggesting?
2015-04-05 18:37:36	BlackBird	I am hoping that what I create -might- be useful to others at least for prototyping purposes.
2015-04-05 18:38:05	awsumpwner27	ReactorScram, the only definition I am aware of for "kinematics" is entirely physics related, and has nothing to do with stuff like linear algebra.
2015-04-05 18:38:09	oldtopman	Ah, I see. No - it's just an idea I've been pondering for a bit.

2015-04-05 19:22:24	Gallefray	CloudPop: ah neat
2015-04-05 19:22:29	CloudPop	Experimenting in general.
2015-04-05 19:22:35	CloudPop	Sunday is prototype day, I just make.. whatever.
2015-04-05 19:23:20	CloudPop	I generated a scene with some rain, looks solid, and now I am working on adding a little character and apply some lighting.
2015-04-05 19:24:12	keeyai	nice
2015-04-05 19:24:16	keeyai	I'm also doing a scene with rain
2015-04-05 19:24:38	CloudPop	XD
2015-04-05 19:24:41	greaser	i've mostly just been screwing around with ambisonics
2015-04-05 19:24:52	drnick	awsumpwner27, there isn't really many specific needs to need an "engine"
2015-04-05 19:25:00	CloudPop	I'ver got a larger project I am working on right now during the week, but I tend to do 2 games at once.
2015-04-05 19:25:11	greaser	which are AMAZING and you should use some form of it in your audio engine
2015-04-05 19:25:19	keeyai	I wish I could do 2 things at once... :P
2015-04-05 19:25:28	keeyai	*just
2015-04-05 19:25:31	keeyai	I might actually finish something
2015-04-05 19:25:35	CloudPop	I've found it helps a lot to split my time up about 70/30 on two different projects.
2015-04-05 19:25:39	drnick	awsumpwner27, 3d graphics lib + some math (possibly collision lib) + your usual entity system enough
2015-04-05 19:25:40	CloudPop	And use Sundays as "Anything goes day."
2015-04-05 19:25:50	TimBeaudet	keeyai: as in do one thing then another then back to thing one?
2015-04-05 19:25:56	awsumpwner27	drnick, yes.
2015-04-05 19:26:13	CloudPop	This prevents me from burning out on the main project, while scratching the itch to do all kinds of different things.
2015-04-05 19:26:18	keeyai	TimBeaudet: importantly not 'on to things 3, 4, and 5'
2015-04-05 19:26:23	awsumpwner27	drnick, I could very well model it after Super Mario 64 in regards to its internals.
2015-04-05 19:26:35	keeyai	I have 5  side projects I really fele strongly about right now
2015-04-05 19:26:38	drnick	awsumpwner27, internals?
2015-04-05 19:26:48	awsumpwner27	drnick, how it works on a basic level.
2015-04-05 19:26:49	CloudPop	I sat down and looked at how I develop games and I kinda restructured to embrace my creative desires instead of forcing myself into a box.
2015-04-05 19:26:51	TimBeaudet	keeyai: Yes, that is a trick.  I am trying something I think helps with that attitude.
2015-04-05 19:26:58	keeyai	do tell
2015-04-05 19:27:00	drnick	awsumpwner27, you mean gameplay wise?
2015-04-05 19:27:23	awsumpwner27	drnick, we know a lot about that game due to the efforts of people with lots of time on their hands. (aka TASers)
2015-04-05 19:27:36	TimBeaudet	My big project is a racing simulator, and recently I've put in place "an hour a day to the big picture" meaning that at least an hour each day goes towards something that will help that project.
2015-04-05 19:27:55	awsumpwner27	drnick, I also really like how movement feels in that game.
2015-04-05 19:27:57	drnick	awsumpwner27, if you mean codewise you probably mean ugly C
2015-04-05 19:28:29	awsumpwner27	drnick, I mean, we know the workings of the game on an abstract level.
2015-04-05 19:28:41	TimBeaudet	Right now though, practicing art…  Anyone have a need for simple 3D objects, (blender) I'd like to practice on something that will be useful to someone

2015-04-05 19:29:00	drnick	awsumpwner27, tht thing you saaw used this https://github.com/lucasdealmeidasm/TriangleBox.js and three.js
2015-04-05 19:29:13	drnick	in fact it was a test of that[
2015-04-05 19:29:31	keeyai	TimBeaudet: are you doing scenes? models? rigged animations?
2015-04-05 19:29:57	Gallefray	Can... anyone see a way I can simplify bt_tleft()? http://hastebin.com/abifedigig.lua
2015-04-05 19:30:28	TimBeaudet	Just models at this point
2015-04-05 19:30:39	Gallefray	This isn't production code, I'm just testing myself. I can't really see anywhere else to simplify in that func
2015-04-05 19:30:40	drnick	awsumpwner27, I think you should try that as a project yes, it should be enjoyable and easy
2015-04-05 19:30:53	TimBeaudet	Would be great material for prototyping, I will do my best on it though
2015-04-05 19:31:01	awsumpwner27	drnick, quite.
2015-04-05 19:31:17	keeyai	I'm just playing in 2D at the moment
2015-04-05 19:32:25	TimBeaudet	:-) Me too mostly, but I want to get better
2015-04-05 19:32:50	greaser	Lev: i have a very naive implementation, although i use a 2:1 forward:side multiplier ratio for a headphones model
2015-04-05 19:32:53	drnick	awsumpwner27, using old GL it would be easy to get graphics going

2015-04-05 19:33:47	greaser	basically, take the angle and the -3dB pressure multiplier (1/sqrt(2)), multiply it by the signal, and add that to the b-format stream

2015-04-05 19:40:10	greaser	blender just has a rather steep initial learning curve
2015-04-05 19:40:17	Mixer	Mmango: How did it go?
2015-04-05 19:40:33	drnick	Blender is outright annoying
2015-04-05 19:40:37	CoastersPaul	It's a lot easier than it was before it had a UI overhaul though.
2015-04-05 19:40:40	drnick	there are simpler programs
2015-04-05 19:40:41	Mmango	Mixer, really well. We talked for about half an hour about the composing process, how he got his job, and what tools he uses

2015-04-05 20:32:35	JonasLund	because of mmap / MAP_NOSYNC
2015-04-05 20:32:47	awsumpwner27	I'd have to learn to use new tools though.
2015-04-05 20:32:52	CoastersPaul	awsumpwner27 - Even a Win7 machine is better
2015-04-05 20:33:01	awsumpwner27	It's not worth it.
2015-04-05 20:33:20	ReactorScram	For me it is important to use free software
2015-04-05 20:33:31	JonasLund	awsumpwner27: knowing linux/bsd/etc is a good thing if you want to run simple servers
2015-04-05 20:33:58	greaser	for me it's important that i can screw with the source code just in case stuff is broken
2015-04-05 20:34:07	greaser	also "simple" servers
2015-04-05 20:34:15	greaser	get that "simple" word out of there and store it in your rectum
2015-04-05 20:34:34	JonasLund	awsumpwner27: a cheap and kinda fun way is to get a raspberry pi (it's kinda painful also due to slowness sadly although i guess the new model b2 is better)
2015-04-05 20:34:35	greaser	if you want "simple" servers then that's all windows is good for in terms of servers
2015-04-05 20:34:45	JonasLund	well
2015-04-05 20:34:47	drnick	awsumpwner27, meh
2015-04-05 20:34:54	JonasLund	simple in terms of cheap, less resources
2015-04-05 20:34:55	greaser	i have a not-2 raspi, and yeah there's no divide instruction
2015-04-05 20:34:59	JonasLund	not in terms of management :)
2015-04-05 20:35:01	greaser	ah right
2015-04-05 20:35:18	JonasLund	also like
2015-04-05 20:35:36	JonasLund	you can get a linux VPS for like what.. 5$ a month these days
2015-04-05 20:35:46	JonasLund	some offers free for a year
2015-04-05 20:35:50	ReactorScram	Yeah I have a $5 one

2015-04-05 20:38:11	ReactorScram	That happened with some computers we bought for work
2015-04-05 20:38:14	JonasLund	i lost a big chunk of faith in that last time i tried running linux on my machine
2015-04-05 20:38:20	ReactorScram	Apparently the trick in win8 is to not connect to wifi when you install windows
2015-04-05 20:38:24	JonasLund	had to fix Xfree86/Xorg
2015-04-05 20:38:40	JonasLund	took a year for Xorg to get a fix in because i guess they were too busy renaming the sources or smth :P
2015-04-05 20:39:15	ReactorScram	I'm scared that if I buy a new computer, UEFI will keep it from running Linux properly or something
2015-04-05 20:39:26	ReactorScram	But I got one of the work computers to boot from liveusb when it was broken
2015-04-05 20:39:27	drnick	also that
2015-04-05 20:39:37	JonasLund	win8 requires you to be able to turn off UEFI
2015-04-05 20:39:40	JonasLund	win10 doesn't
2015-04-05 20:39:46	JonasLund	so get one now before win10 becomes the thing

2015-04-05 21:08:42	awsumpwner27	I believe all themes fall onto a continuum of "specificness", and there's a certain amount of specificness that makes a theme great.

2015-04-05 21:09:03	awsumpwner27	I think "Entire game on one screen" was too specific.
2015-04-05 21:09:16	awsumpwner27	Perhaps snowman was too broad.
2015-04-05 21:09:34	CoastersPaul	Is "not a platformer" too specific?
2015-04-05 21:09:43	drnick	yes, entire game on one screen is ridiculously specific

2015-04-05 21:10:14	drnick	but I will not talk of it, there are those here who are very vocal about their liking of this theme
2015-04-05 21:11:32	CoastersPaul	It wasn't the best but it was better than ☃
2015-04-05 21:11:53	drnick	disagree
2015-04-05 21:12:16	awsumpwner27	☃ inspired a generation.
2015-04-05 21:14:03	CoastersPaul	☃ forces your game to have a ☃, and in that way it's no better than themes named after an already-existing character.
2015-04-05 21:14:43	CoastersPaul	But I sort of hope that ☃shows up again.
2015-04-05 21:15:32	awsumpwner27	If you really wanted to you could just have ☃ be some kind of abstract concept relating to ☃.

2015-04-05 21:16:00	awsumpwner27	But you know you'll get a bad score with "egoos" if your entire game isn't on one screen.

2015-04-08 00:36:29	gajop	what's the policy on derivative work with regards to ground(background) textures? are we supposed to draw them/make photos so that they aren't considered derivative, or is it enough to just adjust/blend textures?
2015-04-08 00:36:31	%NeiloGD	no reason python won't run on mobile..
2015-04-08 00:36:47	JonasLund	keeyai: been working on this JS->C compiler that's tailing V8 in performance , that compiler is quite big however and have some deviations in the language semantics (more strict so code that works with it would work on the web)
2015-04-08 00:36:54	gingerale	NeiloGD: I meant people not in it already. Like you look at Py3, you see you should use that because it's being developed, but then you see that everyone else still uses Py2, and you don't want to start using that because it just gets some security updates.
2015-04-08 00:36:56	keeyai	NeiloGD: as far as I know it is still not allowed on the appstore

2015-04-08 00:38:01	gingerale	I might start using Python once they allow recompiling functions during runtime.
2015-04-08 00:38:02	JonasLund	keeyai: i did a quick JS->C++ hack that's more in line with standard javascript semantics and last week i figured out some fairly "smart" ideas about optimizing that compiler that's bought the second one down to within half of V8's speed, not as fast as the first compiler was but the compiler is smaller and potentially more compatible
2015-04-08 00:38:18	keeyai	I almost went to the talk by guido about eventual typing
2015-04-08 00:38:43	gingerale	Well, I'm off to work. Have a good day, everyone.
2015-04-08 00:38:50	keeyai	JonasLund: within half of v8? like 2x as fast?
2015-04-08 00:38:59	JonasLund	keeyai: no i mean.. 2x slower
2015-04-08 00:39:03	keeyai	ah
2015-04-08 00:39:06	keeyai	impressive though
2015-04-08 00:39:59	JonasLund	keeyai: that brings me to the question though, how it stack up to the current native JS options on iOS and what i should continue working on
2015-04-08 00:40:40	JonasLund	(I also have one more potentially good trick up my sleeve that might bring up the more compatible compilers performance)

2015-04-08 00:48:36	awsumpwner27	You kind of have to use and modify the premade asset in such a way that it's not recognizable as having been premade at all. Like, you can't just make it brighter and call it a day. Stuff like going in and painting over it and overlaying other images on it to make something new is the kind of edit that's okay.

2015-04-08 01:00:38	awsumpwner27	I did once.
2015-04-08 01:00:45	awsumpwner27	Pretty good on the textures.
2015-04-08 01:00:55	awsumpwner27	Took me so long I went into the Jam.

2015-04-08 01:01:08	gajop	we'll make all the art from scratch
2015-04-08 01:01:26	Dezzles	That's my strategy... Mostly
2015-04-08 01:01:35	awsumpwner27	Make original art and over run into jam or use premade assets and enter Jam?
2015-04-08 01:01:37	Dezzles	I used one derivate piece in the last compo
2015-04-08 01:01:47	gajop	never been in a LD jam or compo xD
2015-04-08 01:02:11	Dezzles	But that was a snowman
2015-04-08 01:02:38	awsumpwner27	In some ways the distinction between compo rules and jam rules seem literally insane.
2015-04-08 01:02:52	Dezzles	such as?
2015-04-08 01:03:08	awsumpwner27	Compo's designed, relative to the Jam, so that you can do less in less time.
2015-04-08 01:03:42	Dezzles	I think it's more that the jam is designed for you to do more in more time, rather than the other way around
2015-04-08 01:04:50	awsumpwner27	Kind of the hardest of hardcores versus a pretty average kind of hardcore.
2015-04-08 01:05:39	Dezzles	That's what LD had been though, it was loosened to create the Jams
2015-04-08 01:05:52	Dezzles	Because some people wanted something more relaxed
2015-04-08 01:06:16	awsumpwner27	To be clear, I don't think anything should be changed.

2015-04-08 05:18:26	Tijn	I did listen, but that made my point impossible, so I ignored it :P
2015-04-08 05:18:35	bitslap	but for main LD we want more variety and less direction
2015-04-08 05:18:39	bitslap	ha ha
2015-04-08 05:18:42	bitslap	fair enough
2015-04-08 05:19:04	Tijn	But is there really such a difference between miniLD and real LD?
2015-04-08 05:19:27	CloudPop	Dude.
2015-04-08 05:19:33	CloudPop	Some of those Arkanoid levels, lol what.
2015-04-08 05:20:23	bitslap	Tijn: yes big difference =)
2015-04-08 05:20:37	CloudPop	I'm not a fan of mechanic restricting themes.
2015-04-08 05:20:41	bitslap	main LD is like the main thing and mini LD's are fillers so that the community have something more to do
2015-04-08 05:21:25	CloudPop	"Farming Simulator."
2015-04-08 05:21:35	CloudPop	Pretty much means everyone is building a farming simulator.
2015-04-08 05:22:05	bitslap	this is why i want Charge as an alternative in the theme voting
2015-04-08 05:22:13	bitslap	i almost chose that one for my miniLD
2015-04-08 05:22:27	CloudPop	Although I have an idea for a farming simulator.
2015-04-08 05:22:31	CloudPop	That's kinda bonkers.
2015-04-08 05:22:33	CloudPop	Heh
2015-04-08 05:23:12	Tijn	I could make an interesting farming simulator I think
2015-04-08 05:23:39	CloudPop	Mine would have marshmellows and aliens.
2015-04-08 05:24:08	Tijn	One that gets increasingly difficult over time because of unfair competition from artificially low subsidised wages
2015-04-08 05:24:22	Tijn	So you need to get loans to upgrade your stuff in order to stay competitive
2015-04-08 05:24:30	Tijn	But that weighs your profits down
2015-04-08 05:24:47	Tijn	In the end you barely survive and thats when your son has to take over
2015-04-08 05:25:23	bitslap	=)
2015-04-08 05:25:27	bitslap	damn banks

2015-04-08 05:26:19	CloudPop	What.
2015-04-08 05:28:53	Mixer	How do you guys deal with architecture questions like “Should construction be done by the tiled class or by the item class”?

2015-04-08 05:29:24	Mixer	F spelling.
2015-04-08 05:29:37	bitslap	oh yes, i would love to experiment with a game that triggers arachnophobia
2015-04-08 05:29:47	bitslap	i wonder if i could do that with pixel art and side scroll
2015-04-08 05:30:07	bitslap	i think key mechanics would have to be that the small spiders are really dangerous to the player
2015-04-08 05:30:24	bitslap	and that they suddenly appear when moving, lifting, breaking stuff
2015-04-08 05:30:27	bitslap	or turning on the lights
2015-04-08 05:30:37	bitslap	and their movement has to be "small fast spider"
2015-04-08 05:31:15	Tijn	I'd make a game about someone who's afraid to go outside
2015-04-08 05:31:22	Tijn	And then in the end say "What? That's not arachnophobia? Hmmm"
2015-04-08 05:31:32	bitslap	lol
2015-04-08 05:31:51	Mixer	Tijn: Use the internet to avoid world disaster.

2015-04-08 07:01:01	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: framerate seems quite low
2015-04-08 07:01:08	Tijn	[13:57:53]  <awsumpwner27> how did generations past live without GLU?
2015-04-08 07:01:12	Tijn	What the hell is GLU?
2015-04-08 07:01:25	theweirdn8	@Sol_HSA, its cam studio
2015-04-08 07:02:16	@Sol_HSA	Tijn: a minimal set of functions you need to get stuff going in 3d, like lookat and perspective matrix calc
2015-04-08 07:02:23	theweirdn8	i n33d a better video recorder
2015-04-08 07:02:36	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: I use bandicam

2015-04-08 07:03:33	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: hard to say what it "feels" like with framerate like that =)
2015-04-08 07:03:49	theweirdn8	rofl
2015-04-08 07:03:49	Alfie275	I don't use GLU
2015-04-08 07:04:12	theweirdn8	how do u make game levels without a GUI?
2015-04-08 07:04:13	@Sol_HSA	if you use shaders, you don't use glu in any case
2015-04-08 07:04:16	Alfie275	I do use GLM though, which implements a lot of the helpful stuff
2015-04-08 07:04:26	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: depends on what you're doing
2015-04-08 07:04:31	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: maybe you se photoshop, maybe blender
2015-04-08 07:04:43	theweirdn8	..........
2015-04-08 07:04:52	theweirdn8	and do precise collision checks for errthang?
2015-04-08 07:05:36	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: which part of "depends on what you're doing" is hard to grasp? =)
2015-04-08 07:06:49	@Sol_HSA	theweirdn8: if you go through the effort of making a custom-built tool to do your levels, you'll end up with a different product than by, say, color-coding pixels in photoshop, but both are methods that have been used in the past
2015-04-08 07:07:55	theweirdn8	yea
2015-04-08 07:08:47	mikembp	custom built tool is nice but it means you'll spend all your time developing that time as opposed to working on your game
2015-04-08 07:09:07	Gnx	Sol_HSA: I think it'd be really good if there were examples of "pong in <x> language in about 100 lines" and "pong in Unreal Engine in 8 hours"
2015-04-08 07:09:37	theweirdn8	yea, it was a neccesary evil for us
2015-04-08 07:10:01	theweirdn8	since depending on many others to port to our target systems got a bit expensive and time consuming(For wait)
2015-04-08 07:10:21	theweirdn8	unity3d is probably the best tool for super cross-platform but its gui though doesnt click with me
2015-04-08 07:11:17	Gnx	theweirdn8: it is also worth thinking how valuable massive portability is

2015-04-08 07:12:52	@Sol_HSA	Gnx: the problem with that is that games need a lot of things many languages can't even access, namely input, output and time
2015-04-08 07:13:16	Gnx	Sol_HSA: well, mine is more a thought experiment on using the right gauge of tool for your project
2015-04-08 07:13:22	@Sol_HSA	Gnx: for example, you can't do a pong with php. not a sane pong, anyway.
2015-04-08 07:13:37	Gnx	Sol_HSA: I could do a text adventure pong
2015-04-08 07:13:43	@Sol_HSA	Gnx: and while you can do pong with lua, you basically need löve to do it

2015-04-08 07:14:02	@Sol_HSA	Gnx: or very, very low framerate..
2015-04-08 07:14:17	Gnx	Sol_HSA: okay perhaps Löve vs. Unreal Engine is more apt comparison
2015-04-08 07:14:29	Gnx	because they operate roughly in the same layer of things
2015-04-08 07:15:07	@Sol_HSA	Gnx: yeah, only, one is more suitable for pong and the other for a first person shooter..
2015-04-08 07:15:33	Gnx	Sol_HSA: anyway, my point is more about people believing that tools will be the decisive factor in making their game
2015-04-08 07:16:04	Tijn	You can do a very sane Pong with Javascript though
2015-04-08 07:16:09	Tijn	Everyone can run it in their browser
2015-04-08 07:16:21	Gnx	that UE4 games are intrinsically better than löve games
2015-04-08 07:16:58	Tijn	There are a lot of musicians who believe buying more and better stuff will make their music better
2015-04-08 07:17:08	Tijn	"Gearsluts" the incrowd calls them
2015-04-08 07:17:18	fazias	:|
2015-04-08 07:17:26	Tijn	People are just like that I think... blaming their tools for their own failings
2015-04-08 07:17:27	FARTRON	some people just like buying things
2015-04-08 07:17:30	Tijn	Yeah
2015-04-08 07:17:32	Tijn	Women :P
2015-04-08 07:17:36	FARTRON	oh ok
2015-04-08 07:17:46	FARTRON	so it's not just about shaming people who have different priorities than you it's also about misogyny
2015-04-08 07:17:47	FARTRON	cool
2015-04-08 07:17:59	@Sol_HSA	Tijn: then again, you can run linux kernel in javascript
2015-04-08 07:18:35	Tijn	Yeah, so people shouldn't complain about not being able to run your Linux game, Sol_HSA 
2015-04-08 07:18:36	Gnx	Tijn: I think with music and some other things there is a "treshold" level, but it is very low
2015-04-08 07:18:46	Tijn	"Just run it in your browser, using Javascript"
2015-04-08 07:18:59	Tijn	What do you mean, Gnx?
2015-04-08 07:19:02	Gnx	like if you're going to buy a mic, don't buy a $30 mic
2015-04-08 07:19:18	Tijn	Oh yeah, but that's the big thing though
2015-04-08 07:19:22	Tijn	Better stuff *is* better

2015-04-08 07:19:29	Tijn	But buying a better mic doesn't make you a better singer
2015-04-08 07:19:38	Tijn	That doesn't mean you should buy the cheapest mic ever
2015-04-08 07:19:44	@Sol_HSA	Tijn: I've been converting my stuff to run on a browser through emscripten for that precise reason
2015-04-08 07:19:48	@Sol_HSA	Tijn: no need to download binaries
2015-04-08 07:19:53	Gnx	Tijn: yeah, but the curve obviously goes flatter very fast
2015-04-08 07:20:13	@Sol_HSA	sometimes good stuff makes you worse
2015-04-08 07:20:16	@Sol_HSA	like with cameras
2015-04-08 07:20:24	@Sol_HSA	anyone can use a compact camera
2015-04-08 07:20:32	Tijn	Well... I don't know if I can really participate in this discussion, Gnx
2015-04-08 07:20:45	Tijn	As I've spent thousands of euros on microphones :P
2015-04-08 07:22:11	Gnx	$100 mic is hugely better than $30 mic
2015-04-08 07:22:12	Mixerman123	Good news: I can pretty much promise you guys I will make an IRC vote bot.
2015-04-08 07:22:17	Mixerman123	:D
2015-04-08 07:22:29	Gnx	but $200 mic is not as much better than a $100 :P
2015-04-08 07:22:49	Tijn	Yeah, well
2015-04-08 07:23:01	Tijn	I dunno man, I still want the $ 200 one :P
2015-04-08 07:23:06	Gnx	sure
2015-04-08 07:23:21	Gnx	but you need more knowledge and the improvements are less obvious
2015-04-08 07:23:30	Gnx	like if anyone asks me about buying their first mic
2015-04-08 07:23:32	Tijn	Yeah, I understand what you're saying
2015-04-08 07:23:37	Gnx	I use the $100 as the price point
2015-04-08 07:23:49	Gnx	because you can get an SM57 for that :P

2015-04-08 07:24:06	Gnx	with very passable fidelity
2015-04-08 07:24:21	Tijn	I'd suggest one of those USB condenser mics they have now
2015-04-08 07:24:31	Gnx	Tijn: sure

2015-04-08 08:13:01	@pekuja	but I'd usually prefer if it was something a bit abstract if it's like that
2015-04-08 08:13:17	@pekuja	though maybe not quite as abstract as the Global Game Jam themes lately :D

2015-04-08 08:14:32	@pekuja	that was... you know, it was all right, but I felt liked it pushed ideas towards multiplayer, I think
2015-04-08 08:14:43	@pekuja	which actually kinda made me give up
2015-04-08 08:14:50	tacospice	oh man
2015-04-08 08:14:52	@pekuja	because I ended up being solo
2015-04-08 08:15:00	@pekuja	but I wanted to make a multiplayer game

2015-04-08 08:15:35	@pekuja	I mean, really it might have worked but I think I was just in a bad state of mind or something and I actually just gave up after some initial planning and stuff

2015-04-08 08:36:22	@pekuja	I think for a while I thought that the Ludum Dare system was problematic and we should do more curation on it
2015-04-08 08:36:33	bitslap	they have been more "do whatever" than "lets see how people intrepet this"
2015-04-08 08:36:43	@pekuja	but clearly the fully curated method has some problems too
2015-04-08 08:37:28	bitslap	they should adapt the ludum dare model and just announce the theme winner when the event starts
2015-04-08 08:37:46	bitslap	they could curate the alternatives

2015-04-08 09:37:49	Sk3letor	voxel, I almost fixed that bug but I no idea how to solve problem between wobble and lean :(
2015-04-08 09:38:00	C64Gamer	Is someone here knowing a good game client/server framework written in java ? 
2015-04-08 09:38:11	C64Gamer	Hey hissssssssss  :-) How are you ?
2015-04-08 09:38:53	C64Gamer	Everone is talking about Nadron that uses netty.io. I can't find any docs about that 
2015-04-08 09:41:49	voxel	Sk3letor: whats the problem, what have you tried, how do you want it to work
2015-04-08 09:42:50	hissssssssss	C64Gamer: All right. Pretty tired but powering through it because I have lots of exciting stuff that I need to finish soon.
2015-04-08 09:43:22	Sk3letor	voxel: cant switch to both things :I
2015-04-08 09:43:34	hissssssssss	If I don't finish some of this stuff before LD, it'll get put on hold for weeks.
2015-04-08 09:43:39	voxel	i dont really know what kind of wobble you want, Sk3letor
2015-04-08 09:43:44	C64Gamer	hissssssssss: Then go go go. We are fine too. Started with Atomic Vikings our first "real" project.
2015-04-08 09:44:20	hissssssssss	C64Gamer: Yeah? What kind of project?
2015-04-08 09:45:12	Sk3letor	voxel: I cant make that test2.z to be both
2015-04-08 09:45:32	Sk3letor	voxel: like test2.z = leanCurrentAngle; or test2.z = wobbleRotation.z;
2015-04-08 09:45:38	C64Gamer	hissssssssss: You know the game "Dynatech"? It is from 2 german dev from the 1991. We will make a remake from it to use it on modern hardware. Biggest feature will be the multiplayer over the internet.
2015-04-08 09:45:40	Sk3letor	only other works for it

2015-04-08 09:47:20	Sk3letor	only z but the problem is that only one of these works.
2015-04-08 09:47:42	hissssssssss	C64Gamer: Sounds ambitious. Good luck with that!
2015-04-08 09:47:50	C64Gamer	hissssssssss: Thx :-)
2015-04-08 09:48:02	voxel	Sk3letor: okay. so make a new float called wobbleAngle, like we did with leanAngle
2015-04-08 09:48:20	JonasLund	anyone else with a broken firefox ? since the 37 update it's all broken with images :(
2015-04-08 09:48:24	Sk3letor	voxel: one sec, there is something wrong with lean again.

2015-04-08 21:14:33	Aelloon	and should be illegal
2015-04-08 21:14:40	drnick	for everyone else, if the army doesn't want you when you are 18 you are free
2015-04-08 21:14:51	Aelloon	it should be illegal for a country to require conscription

2015-04-08 21:15:15	Aelloon	well the biggest military force in the world does not use conscription
2015-04-08 21:15:17	drnick	for med students, they can request you after you graduate, and even if they don't want you then, they can request you at any time
2015-04-08 21:15:17	Aelloon	so... they could?
2015-04-08 21:15:39	drnick	so I have it worse than my friends studying engineering
2015-04-08 21:15:57	Aelloon	i was exempt from conscription because of my poor health

2015-04-08 21:20:04	drnick	but there are only a few recently graduated doctors who haven't served the army before entering med school
2015-04-08 21:21:20	awsumpwner27	drnick, would they have had to start when they're like, 12?
2015-04-08 21:22:09	drnick	after july of the year of your 18th birthday
2015-04-08 21:22:56	drnick	and if you count the time it takes to finish high school you can't enter before being 17
2015-04-08 21:25:19	awsumpwner27	drnick, if a child can demonstrate exceptional ability in school, they stand a chance of being able to advance a grade without waiting for a year.
2015-04-08 21:25:29	awsumpwner27	drnick, at least where I'm from.
2015-04-08 21:26:00	drnick	here not so much
2015-04-08 21:27:13	drnick	technically you could make the "suppletive" and complete high school in a few months by passing a test showing that you have all the knowledge (it is mostly aimed at students who didn't finish high school)
2015-04-08 21:27:21	drnick	to get the high school degree
2015-04-08 21:27:27	drnick	and then pass the admission test being younger
2015-04-08 21:27:40	drnick	why would you want that though
2015-04-08 21:27:44	awsumpwner27	drnick, what? Really?
2015-04-08 21:28:09	awsumpwner27	drnick, I've suggested that to teachers when I was growing up and they tried to discourage me.
2015-04-08 21:28:17	drnick	they are right
2015-04-08 21:28:21	drnick	well it would be impossible
2015-04-08 21:28:34	drnick	it is hard to pass the admission test
2015-04-08 21:28:44	drnick	not impossible but would require some serious studying
2015-04-08 21:28:51	drnick	also who would want that
2015-04-08 21:29:32	drnick	you would lose the experience of going through high school at the right age, being different from the others, you'd be much younger than all your classmates
2015-04-08 21:29:33	awsumpwner27	drnick, I'd study harder if it meant I could attempt a supertest any time I wanted.
2015-04-08 21:29:41	drnick	patients wouldn't respect you
2015-04-08 21:29:47	drnick	and probably there would be legal problems

2015-04-27 09:45:59	TimBeaudet	But then, I was talking 80k before taxes, which would be like 50k after.
2015-04-27 09:46:09	rnlf	still 50% more for me

2015-04-27 09:47:03	rnlf	but it's probably not like 50% higher living cost
2015-04-27 09:47:04	marcus	That being said, a lot of the devs I know are also highly paid for their cost of living, too.
2015-04-27 09:47:05	mattpattie	hi tim
2015-04-27 09:47:34	TimBeaudet	I've just always been bad at negotiating price.
2015-04-27 09:47:39	marcus	(This, luckily, includes myself ... though the job security in tech in my area is sometimes iffy)
2015-04-27 09:47:52	rnlf	but this company has a tradition of never giving really a big raise, so everyone's more or less on their entry salary. and this is my first job after university
2015-04-27 09:47:54	TimBeaudet	The last two places I've worked I got more than I asked for initially.
2015-04-27 09:48:12	rnlf	one reason more to find something new
2015-04-27 09:48:27	TimBeaudet	After talking with others, I'm not asking for enough.
2015-04-27 09:48:44	marcus	Negotiating salary is such a strange concept for me. I'e never had the option to do so. In my area, tech jobs at most companies are standardized based on market values.
2015-04-27 09:49:16	TimBeaudet	I'm too humble to consider myself worth the value I am.
2015-04-27 09:50:01	TimBeaudet	But honestly, after the student loans are paid off money will be minimal concern for me.
2015-04-27 09:50:19	rnlf	that's what i thought, but then you want to buy a house or something
2015-04-27 09:50:22	TimBeaudet	enough to pay rent and survive, but for now lets murder the loan.
2015-04-27 09:50:29	rnlf	it'll make a big difference if you pay for 20 years or only 10 ;-)
2015-04-27 09:50:39	TimBeaudet	buying a house is essentially the same as renting
2015-04-27 09:50:51	rnlf	short term yes, but long term?
2015-04-27 09:50:59	TimBeaudet	long term far better
2015-04-27 09:51:31	rnlf	just imagine how much money you save after buying a house and being done with the mortgage
2015-04-27 09:51:38	TimBeaudet	I'm actually looking at buying a house here soon.  Prices though are scary
2015-04-27 09:51:48	rnlf	yeah
2015-04-27 09:51:49	rnlf	same here
2015-04-27 09:51:59	marcus	Depending on your current market and the interest rates available, buying a house right now could be an amazing opportunity.
2015-04-27 09:52:13	rnlf	interest rates are on a historic low, so prices are beyond good and evil

2015-04-27 09:54:49	TimBeaudet	I grew up in a place where that sort of money would buy a huge, very amazing house, nearing a "mansion"
2015-04-27 09:55:13	TimBeaudet	Of course no job opportunities there either… but that's part of the story.

2015-04-27 09:55:22	rnlf	in the suburbs it's better, but there is limit road bandwidth in the rush hour
2015-04-27 09:55:24	rnlf	so it would take away at least two hours of my day to move to the suburb
2015-04-27 09:56:04	TimBeaudet	Yea, I'd recommend public transport if there is a good train/transit system in the area.
2015-04-27 09:56:23	rnlf	that'll take just as long :D
2015-04-27 09:56:32	TimBeaudet	At least then on the (probably same amount of time) trip you can read books.
2015-04-27 09:56:37	rnlf	oh
2015-04-27 09:56:38	rnlf	true
2015-04-27 09:56:41	rnlf	good point
2015-04-27 09:56:44	rnlf	always forget about this
2015-04-27 09:56:47	FARTRON	driving is the worst
2015-04-27 09:56:53	FARTRON	its stressful and expensive
2015-04-27 09:56:59	TimBeaudet	I don't mind driving OUTSIDE of a city.
2015-04-27 09:57:00	rnlf	at the moment i live 8 minutes by foot away from work
2015-04-27 09:57:13	rnlf	doesn't get much better than that
2015-04-27 09:57:13	TimBeaudet	Actually quite peaceful and enjoyable, "back home"
2015-04-27 09:57:32	FARTRON	this is 2015 everywhere is a city
2015-04-27 09:57:39	rnlf	i don't consider driving stressful, just very time consuming and yes, expensive
2015-04-27 09:57:56	xrlk	ya
2015-04-27 09:57:58	xrlk	i only fly
2015-04-27 09:58:47	rnlf	i usually take a jetpack to work and back
2015-04-27 09:58:48	xrlk	it helps to fly chartered to avoid the overhead time
2015-04-27 09:58:54	TimBeaudet	FARTRON: my home town is not a city by any means.  It also has 4 seasons each year instead of two.
2015-04-27 09:59:18	xrlk	yea
2015-04-27 09:59:21	xrlk	4 seasons suck
2015-04-27 09:59:29	xrlk	winter was super long this year
2015-04-27 09:59:40	TimBeaudet	4 seasons is the awesome!!!   I miss winter!
2015-04-27 09:59:42	xrlk	i'll probably move one day

2015-04-27 10:47:50	bitslap	there are enough game jams to jamming every day Sk3letor.

2015-04-27 10:47:59	bitslap	you just have to pick the one that isnt as offending to you as LD

2015-04-27 10:48:16	awsumpwner27	The thing about tournaments is that if the second best player plays the best player in the first round and loses, then their placement in last place makes no sense.
2015-04-27 10:48:21	marcus	Phi, of the games I've rated so far, I like Shield Maiden, Cooper 32 and Portal Miner for the gameplay, and Boreocracy for how it feels.
2015-04-27 10:48:32	awsumpwner27	The addition of a loser's bracket does so much to remedy that.

2015-04-27 11:08:22	_DB	with a acharacter controller
2015-04-27 11:08:35	Sk3letor	but how I detect it then?
2015-04-27 11:08:37	_DB	either remove the character controller and use the rigidbody and a collider
2015-04-27 11:08:46	_DB	or use the character controller
2015-04-27 11:08:55	Phi	i never use a character controller btw
2015-04-27 11:09:02	Phi	generlaly roll my own rigidbody/collider thing
2015-04-27 11:09:07	_DB	if you use character controller you use Move() and OnControllerCollission for that
2015-04-27 11:09:16	Phi	cus then you can use forces and react with the environment properly
2015-04-27 11:09:19	Phi	ie. push objects around
2015-04-27 11:09:22	_DB	yeah I use character controller myself but im considering making my own
2015-04-27 11:09:30	_DB	people have been telling me it works / runs better?
2015-04-27 11:09:30	_DB	idk
2015-04-27 11:09:40	_DB	same general crap really I guess
2015-04-27 11:09:48	Phi	i used my own for TinyKeep
2015-04-27 11:09:54	Phi	but then again that uses Legacy Animations not Mecanim
2015-04-27 11:09:57	Phi	so results will vary 
2015-04-27 11:10:20	_DB	are there any noteworthy changes from rigidbodys and collider to using a character controller?
2015-04-27 11:10:38	Sk3letor	Phi, _DB: what if I make a child for it as rigidbody as kinematic?
2015-04-27 11:10:39	_DB	I know they have different but similar functions
2015-04-27 11:11:03	_DB	well you can have a rigidbody with your character controller
2015-04-27 11:11:07	_DB	its just not neccesary
2015-04-27 11:11:09	Phi	Sk3letor i have no idea what your issue is anymore
2015-04-27 11:11:22	_DB	if you want to use the rigidbody you need to add a OnCollisionEnter to both objects colliding
2015-04-27 11:11:50	_DB	for some reason when one has a characterController it gets ignored unless both objects have a OnCollisionEnter
2015-04-27 11:11:53	Sk3letor	Phi: the issue was that script didint detect cause player uses Character Controller

2015-04-27 11:32:51	TimBeaudet	I guess I don't see why it should need to upload anything back, it should all happen in that local repo
2015-04-27 11:32:56	dos	they only need to be "commited again" if there's merge needed - you need to somehow connect both remote and local branches
2015-04-27 11:33:15	dos	so you don't have two separate ones, but one with changes from both branches
2015-04-27 11:33:18	deniska	TimBeaudet: uploading is git push
2015-04-27 11:33:28	TimBeaudet	deniska: I understand that
2015-04-27 11:33:46	dos	TimBeaudet: commits are in a tree, merge let's you join branches
2015-04-27 11:33:49	deniska	TimBeaudet: I could draw a circle commit diagram but I'm kinda lazy =)
2015-04-27 11:34:10	dos	so obviously you need a commit to do that
2015-04-27 11:34:17	deniska	git log with a flag I don't remember can draw it for you
2015-04-27 11:34:18	TimBeaudet	I give up trying.  I'll just do what I know seems to work, even though I don't understand the why 
2015-04-27 11:34:26	Uhfgood	Lev - apparently I was still trying to move enemies when they were no longer in service... however... it doesn't seem to have made much of a difference for the original test
2015-04-27 11:34:38	Lev	huh ok
2015-04-27 11:34:50	TimBeaudet	afaik I'm not working on separate branches
2015-04-27 11:34:57	dos	TimBeaudet: you are
2015-04-27 11:35:10	deniska	TimBeaudet: your local branch and remote branch
2015-04-27 11:35:18	dos	TimBeaudet: even if you don't explicitely, a "old" branch on remote repo is separate from your "new" local branch
2015-04-27 11:35:22	deniska	considering that you are working from two machines, it is basically 3 branches

2015-04-27 11:40:55	dos	TimBeaudet: if there weren't any remote commits in mean time, you wouldn't need any merge

2015-04-27 11:41:35	dos	TimBeaudet: the point where it goes into two branches is time of your last pull on local branch; time where two branches merge is when you push (and, well, merge) it

2015-04-27 11:42:36	dos	TimBeaudet: if you're the only developer and you just use git to synchronize between machines and keep version control, then simply remember to always pull before starting working on a code
2015-04-27 11:43:01	dos	TimBeaudet: this way you'll avoid having to do merge, cause you won't get diversed branches like on my oh-so-amazing infographic

2015-04-27 12:52:06	Aelloon	and you have to account for the part where the snake fills the entire screen and you have to place it randomly in that spot
2015-04-27 12:52:18	Aelloon	and if your design is to randomly place food and try again if that is occupied that's just bad design

2015-04-27 12:55:13	Aelloon	where you keep track of what's in literally every single tile

2015-04-27 12:57:35	Lev	mm true, though the tails are usually infinite length
2015-04-27 12:57:37	Aelloon	i would just place food randomly

2015-04-27 12:58:06	Alfie275_	Aelloon: You could use a hashing algorithm, since this is exactly the same issue as hash collisions in a hash map
2015-04-27 12:58:25	Lev	I remember I once complained to a manager about using random selection on an ever decreasing list - he told me to go and test the realworld speeds of the worst case scenarios, and it reeeeeally usually doesn't matter

2015-04-27 12:59:00	Uhfgood	hmm
2015-04-27 12:59:03	Uhfgood	wait maybe...
2015-04-27 12:59:03	ReactorScram	It would be just my luck to be born into that universe where the RNG is crap and never picks the right free square
2015-04-27 12:59:05	Lev	Uhfgood: they keep popping up huh - what's happened? :o
2015-04-27 12:59:10	Aelloon	you just create a random location
2015-04-27 12:59:19	Aelloon	check if you can place it there and if you can you break out of the while true loop
2015-04-27 12:59:46	Aelloon	ReactorScram, yeah and then you wrote it in C
2015-04-27 12:59:48	Uhfgood	Lev - I have to consider the other ids moving down and go and update the correct enemy
2015-04-27 12:59:48	Lev	theoretically, a true RNG could infinitely pick the same wrong square - but a PRNG would never realistically do so
2015-04-27 12:59:52	Aelloon	and used the built in random generator
2015-04-27 13:00:02	Aelloon	so it would always generate the same random sequence every time you played
2015-04-27 13:00:06	bitslap	euske: you around?
2015-04-27 13:00:11	Aelloon	so it would always crash when you got to that
2015-04-27 13:00:13	ReactorScram	Aelloon: Yeah I used the C98 standard which is probably freaking RANDU or something
2015-04-27 13:00:32	Aelloon	i mean the basic random in C will generate the same random every time
2015-04-27 13:00:37	Alfie275_	If you wanted to be super lazy, instead of randomly picking again, just pick a random direction and then travel in that direction (looping with an offset on screen edges) until you find a free square
2015-04-27 13:00:38	Aelloon	you run the application if you don't manually change the seed
2015-04-27 13:00:46	ReactorScram	Aelloon: I didn't seed the RNG for Cowboy Simon so the sequence is always the same, and if you lose it just starts a new game from that point in the sequence
2015-04-27 13:00:53	Uhfgood	If I were doing something like snake, I would put all the locations into an array... do a sort of card-shuffle (pick two random entries and swap them)
2015-04-27 13:00:53	ReactorScram	Aelloon: Yeah all RNGs are supposed to do that
2015-04-27 13:01:01	Uhfgood	and then you simply choose the next number in line
2015-04-27 13:01:02	@the31	If you want to avoid repick, you can find the total number of free squares, find a random free square index, and iterate through squares until you find the indexed free square.
2015-04-27 13:01:11	Uhfgood	this way you would use every number exactly once
2015-04-27 13:01:18	ReactorScram	Uhfgood: Make sure you use fisher-yates shuffle so it's fair

2015-04-27 13:02:13	ReactorScram	fisher-yates is one of my favorite algorithms but in this case you only need one square so you don't have to run the whol algorithm
2015-04-27 13:02:14	Uhfgood	ReactorScram - I don't know anything about shuffles really...
2015-04-27 13:02:39	ReactorScram	Uhfgood: Basically imagine you have a deck of cards. Pick a card at random from the eck, remove it, and put it on the stack
2015-04-27 13:02:43	Lev	I tend to just use built in PRNG functions >_>
2015-04-27 13:02:50	ReactorScram	When the deck runs out, the stack is now shuffled
2015-04-27 13:02:59	Alfie275_	If you want an easy/cheap way to do randomness, something like time()%range, where time() gives smallest time units, will generally suffice
2015-04-27 13:03:13	Uhfgood	ReactorScram - that works :-)
2015-04-27 13:04:00	ReactorScram	I read this funny article on how an online poker website screwed up their PRNG seeding
2015-04-27 13:04:10	@the31	My way is dependent on width and height more than the randomness, so randomness is still better for large fields but when it gets tight picking just once is probably safer.
2015-04-27 13:04:12	Uhfgood	anyhoo, you can use that to pick a new 'random' location, and you basically just iterate through it, because presumably the previous indices were already used
2015-04-27 13:04:17	ReactorScram	Ideally you would have 52! possible shuffles but 52! is one of those numbers you can't even write down
2015-04-27 13:04:21	ReactorScram	maybe
2015-04-27 13:04:26	Alfie275_	IIRC, some old games like Megaman used the frames%range method
2015-04-27 13:04:39	Alfie275_	So you could cheat the RNG by timing your move into a room to an exact frame

2015-04-27 13:06:04	ReactorScram	> Also recall that the seed for a 32-bit random number generator must be a 32-bit number, meaning that there are just over 4 billion possible seeds. Since the deck is reinitialized and the generator re-seeded before each shuffle, only 4 billion possible shuffles can result from this algorithm. Four billion possible shuffles is alarmingly less than 52!.

2015-04-27 13:07:48	Aelloon	People used to think that cracking 56-bit DES in real time would take too long to be feasible, but history has shown otherwise. In January 1997, a secret DES key was recovered in 96 days. Later efforts broke keys in 41 days, then 56 hours, and, in January 1999, in 22 hours and 15 minutes. The leap forward in cracking ability doesn't bode well for small key lengths or small sets of seeds!

2015-04-27 13:56:41	Uhfgood	Lev - I think I've figured out something else
2015-04-27 13:57:17	Uhfgood	VDZ - cy is the enemy's position on the grid, -1 means it's not technically on the grid yet... so then I move it onto the grid
2015-04-27 13:58:19	VDZ	Reg.gameGrid.setVal( enemy.cellX, cy, 0 );
2015-04-27 13:58:29	VDZ	Did you mean 'Reg.gameGrid.setVal( enemy.cellX, 0, enemy.ID );'?
2015-04-27 13:58:36	Jacob123	Zayron: I've always hated water levels and I feel I would really hate programming them
2015-04-27 13:58:42	VDZ	Because that's what would put the enemy on the grid from what I can see
2015-04-27 13:59:13	Uhfgood	I just solved the problem
2015-04-27 14:00:15	Uhfgood	VDZ - no... the first line puts the ID on the grid one space below, presumably because there's an open space... the next line sets the actual current position to 0
2015-04-27 14:00:20	Uhfgood	but I finally figured out my problem
2015-04-27 14:00:46	VDZ	What was it?
2015-04-27 14:00:47	Uhfgood	the thing counting empty spaces would count all of the empty spaces in a column, so it was thinking it needed to move down 1, when instead it needed to just break
2015-04-27 14:02:06	Uhfgood	VDZ - notice line 268 -- if ( currCellValue == 0 ) { numcells++; } -- well it kept counting down to the bottom of the grid... 
2015-04-27 14:02:26	--	joao es conocido ahora como Mete-
2015-04-27 14:02:30	Uhfgood	VDZ - I needed to break out of the loop if the cell value was something other than 0 that means there's no space

2015-04-27 14:16:25	Lev	you may have future troubles when you get chain reactions, where 1 match lines up a second, but that will just involve running your loop again

2015-04-27 14:34:01	Lev	it may if you get burgled
2015-04-27 14:34:49	Uhfgood	Lev - so now the problem with doing the grid logic before tweening is that matches are removed before the tweens get finished

2015-04-27 14:37:26	Uhfgood	Lev - tweening simply means moving the sprites into place... so they fall into the correct grid position -- I decoupled the tweening (movement) from the grid updates and now the grid updates first, which means the animations don't have time to finish
2015-04-27 14:37:51	Lev	I don't understand what problem that creates
2015-04-27 14:38:14	Lev	the grid can assume the sprite is in front of it, even if it's still on its way
2015-04-27 14:38:32	Lev	though you would want to wait for the animations ot finish before checking for new matches

2015-04-27 14:40:25	Uhfgood	hmm yeah

2015-04-27 21:04:56	awsumpwner27	It's weird, I realize now that I could totally use Blender to perform skeletal animation on 2D sprites, and then use a Irrlicht, a 3D rendering engine, to render all the stuff in 2D.

2015-04-27 21:13:44	vede	awsumpwner27, what will skeletal animation with 2d sprites look like in Blender
2015-04-27 21:13:55	awsumpwner27	vede, I have no idea.
2015-04-27 21:15:57	vede	awsumpwner27, don't you think using Irrlicht for a 2d game would be a lot of overhead?
2015-04-27 21:16:15	awsumpwner27	Yes.
2015-04-27 21:16:27	vede	awsumpwner27, for a 2d game you would probably have a much better time using like SFML or SDL
2015-04-27 21:16:44	awsumpwner27	But it's the most convenient... what's the word.. workflow, that's right.
2015-04-27 21:16:45	vede	Both can be used in C++ and they are excellent
2015-04-27 21:17:27	Dezzles	A bit more overhead on SDL off memory though
2015-04-27 21:17:30	awsumpwner27	The only reason I would do it is because it's the software I know would just make it work.
2015-04-27 21:19:01	vede	awsumpwner27, I think it's only the most convenient because it's what you used most recently, not because it's actually the most convenient
2015-04-27 21:19:25	vede	And I'm fairly certain that Irrlicht is not the most convenient option for a 2d game
2015-04-27 21:19:34	awsumpwner27	vede, uh, yes.

2015-04-27 21:23:13	vede	Okay so the way I understand the situation right now is that you were learning to do some 3d stuff with Irrlicht, and very recently decided instead that you wanted to make a 2d game
2015-04-27 21:23:25	awsumpwner27	Nope.
2015-04-27 21:23:39	awsumpwner27	I just said that because I realized it was possible, and easy.

2015-04-27 23:10:52	%NeiloGD	how do you mean manually place?
2015-04-27 23:11:13	%NeiloGD	as in set each mip level in a texture, or tell objects which mip level to use?

2015-04-27 23:15:18	Bcadren	Instead of placing a high res texture and having it calculate mip maps; make a vector texture and input a bunch of versions, which it uses as the various smaller sizes.
2015-04-27 23:15:39	Bcadren	IE doing the different mip levels manually.
2015-04-27 23:18:41	%NeiloGD	so set the mip maps yourself. I'm not sure, but I would hope Unity would let you tbh :)

2015-04-27 23:23:02	%NeiloGD	Well, if it does support DDS, I guess that is how you'd do it Bcadren
2015-04-27 23:23:05	FireSlash	The unity editor will import them.
2015-04-27 23:23:16	FireSlash	I dont' know if unity itself natively uses them internally
2015-04-27 23:23:57	FireSlash	Looks like you can load at runtime as well using LoadRawTextureData
2015-04-27 23:26:18	FireSlash	In any event try it and see if it works in your specific implementation. From what I'm seeing it's not an unsolvable problem even if you don't have full support

2015-04-28 04:38:13	rnlf_	you were a big jquery proponent
2015-04-28 04:38:26	Tijn	Because jQuery apparently doesnt support new Javascript stuff, like Ajax loading binary data

2015-04-28 04:38:47	rnlf	so you do it all yourself?
2015-04-28 04:38:58	Sinuath	I read an article awhile back that mentioned that Jquery loads a lot of unecessary libraries as well, bloating a lot of websites unnecessarily
2015-04-28 04:38:58	rnlf	but you could still use jquery for all the rest
2015-04-28 04:39:00	Tijn	And since I need the web audio API, I'm not targetting older browsers anyway
2015-04-28 04:39:15	Tijn	Yeah, but the rest isn't so much, rnlf, that's the thing
2015-04-28 04:39:24	rnlf	ha
2015-04-28 04:39:31	Tijn	The rest is really about having uniform ways of getting elements and handling events

2015-04-28 04:52:33	Tijn	First of all, there's querySelector and querySelectorAll
2015-04-28 04:52:43	Tijn	Which is basically the same as jQuery's CSS selector engine
2015-04-28 04:52:58	Tijn	It's available in all modern browsers and even IE8 has a little support for it
2015-04-28 04:53:26	rnlf	i can use that to query elements that match a given id/class?
2015-04-28 04:53:35	Tijn	You can just do document.querySelectorAll('#somediv .someclass p') to get the paragraphs inside .someclass inside #somediv
2015-04-28 04:53:54	Tijn	So that's already pretty big
2015-04-28 04:53:58	rnlf	funky
2015-04-28 04:54:05	Tijn	And for events, there is addEventListener()
2015-04-28 04:54:13	rnlf	i think that's basically everything i ever use jquery for
2015-04-28 04:54:22	rnlf	besides animation, which i can do on my own, too
2015-04-28 04:54:39	Tijn	addEventListener() is supported by everything and IE9+
2015-04-28 04:54:44	-->	hdon_ (hdon@AN-53C5BCA3.dhcp.embarqhsd.net) has joined #ludumdare
2015-04-28 04:54:50	Tijn	It's basically the same as jQuery's on() method
2015-04-28 04:55:11	rnlf	i am in the comfortable position where i make website just for my private projects, so i can just decide to completely ignore IE
2015-04-28 04:55:25	Tijn	For example, someElement.addEventListener("click", modifyText);
2015-04-28 04:55:32	Tijn	Which would call modifyText() when someElement is clicked
2015-04-28 04:55:50	rnlf	yeah, i see
2015-04-28 04:56:14	Tijn	And for animation, you can use CSS animations/transitions
2015-04-28 04:56:31	rnlf	hmmm
2015-04-28 04:56:44	Tijn	Especially for basic UI animations, that's all you need most of the time

2015-04-28 04:56:48	rnlf	sounds so much better than loading a several kilobyte jquery ;-)
2015-04-28 04:57:07	Tijn	I would only use Javascript animation if they need to be interactive
2015-04-28 04:57:14	Tijn	Like, if you want to stop an animation half way through or something
2015-04-28 04:57:37	Tijn	But for basic stuff like collapsing / expanding or sliding left/right, CSS animation is fine
2015-04-28 04:57:52	rnlf	i guess, as soon as i resume work on my dev blog site, i'll drop jquery again :-p
2015-04-28 04:57:56	Tijn	Haha
2015-04-28 04:58:13	Tijn	Well, jQuery is still nice for general purpose websites which do need to work on older browsers
2015-04-28 04:58:21	Tijn	But for the music app I'm making, there's really no point
2015-04-28 04:58:35	rnlf	my audience is expected to use up to date browsers
2015-04-28 04:58:46	rnlf	if not gamedevs, who else would
2015-04-28 05:00:19	Tijn	Yeah, I don't have a lot of data on this, but if I look at the Google Analytics for my last LD entry, or for Vlambeer Clone Tycoon (a silly game I made a while ago), there's really very little people using IE
2015-04-28 05:00:28	Tijn	And if they are using IE, it's a relatively modern version, which is fine anyway
2015-04-28 05:01:23	Tijn	Ok, lets get some lunch

2015-04-28 07:15:11	boredDev	granted, I think I went to bed at like 8pm.

2015-04-28 07:16:57	Uhfgood	anyone have any idea of how I could get a list of 80's arcade platformers?
2015-04-28 07:17:12	olligobber	Tijn, he didn't have time to, the level was clearly designed for slower speeds
2015-04-28 07:17:13	VDZ	boredDev; clearly you have a mysterious disease that will kill you within hours
2015-04-28 07:17:22	Tijn	That's the challenge :P
2015-04-28 07:17:23	boredDev	prolly not hours.
2015-04-28 07:17:34	olligobber	Tijn, hold on, I'll show you the worst one
2015-04-28 07:17:59	VDZ	Hours. It's a mysterious undiscovered disease, probably artificially made in a bioweapons facility. Your current symptoms are just foreshadowing for the drama to come
2015-04-28 07:18:05	Tijn	I'm pretty sure it's possible to take that jump and still fly under the porch

2015-04-28 07:19:32	Wonkyth	Uhfgood: wikipedia? :P
2015-04-28 07:19:45	Uhfgood	FARTRON - alright
2015-04-28 07:19:46	olligobber	oh well, wasn't planning on getting a wii anyway
2015-04-28 07:20:00	Tijn	Mario Kart is the only game I've got for the Wii U
2015-04-28 07:20:02	Uhfgood	Wonkyth - i don't think they have a specific-a-list as this but I'll look
2015-04-28 07:20:06	Tijn	I dont care about any of the other games
2015-04-28 07:20:14	VDZ	Tijn; why don't you have SSB4
2015-04-28 07:20:23	Tijn	I dont know
2015-04-28 07:20:24	VDZ	It's the reason I got a Wii U
2015-04-28 07:20:30	Tijn	I've never played any Super Smash Brothers game
2015-04-28 07:20:51	VDZ	You should. SSB for N64 is emulatable, so you have no excuse
2015-04-28 07:21:03	Tijn	But isn't it more like a party game you have to play with other people?
2015-04-28 07:21:22	VDZ	You can play vs AI, and in Brawl (3) and 4 you can play online
2015-04-28 07:21:23	Wonkyth	yeah, you have to play with others
2015-04-28 07:21:28	Wonkyth	AI is piss-easy
2015-04-28 07:21:36	VDZ	Also, it's not necessarily a party game - it depends on how you play it
2015-04-28 07:21:45	Tijn	I dont think my gf is up for a fighting game
2015-04-28 07:21:51	Tijn	And she's the only one I play games with :P
2015-04-28 07:21:56	VDZ	You can play 4-player matches which are pretty random and party-like, 1v1 is dead serious though
2015-04-28 07:22:12	VDZ	Wonkyth; agreed, but that's not apparent to a newbie
2015-04-28 07:22:25	Tijn	I dont know, I'm not really a fan of fighting games
2015-04-28 07:22:33	Wonkyth	VDZ: it doesn't take long to get 100% mastery of smash bros AI :P
2015-04-28 07:22:39	VDZ	SSB is very different from other fighting games
2015-04-28 07:22:48	%NeiloGD	you don't scare me voxel.
2015-04-28 07:22:51	Wonkyth	VDZ: heck, I've never even owned a console and I can beat them 8 times out of 10
2015-04-28 07:22:53	%NeiloGD	(although Dezzles did)
2015-04-28 07:22:55	boredDev	my gf particularly enjoyed playing soul calibur 5 with me.
2015-04-28 07:23:03	VDZ	.........................
2015-04-28 07:23:17	VDZ	Winning 8 out of 10 times is nowhere near 100% mastery
2015-04-28 07:23:23	Wonkyth	VDZ: indeed
2015-04-28 07:23:26	boredDev	haha
2015-04-28 07:23:34	Wonkyth	VDZ: and I play it maybe 5 times a year, tops
2015-04-28 07:23:48	VDZ	From Melee onwards there's a special mode called 'Cruel Melee' precisely to demonstrate your AI mastery
2015-04-28 07:23:53	voxel	NeiloGD: did he attack you, or did he just tell you that he was asked to
2015-04-28 07:23:59	Wonkyth	VDZ: that might change something :P
2015-04-28 07:24:16	VDZ	You play against 5 AIs whose characters are all far stronger than you, and try to get as many kills as possible without dying once
2015-04-28 07:24:27	VDZ	Game ends when you die
2015-04-28 07:24:34	VDZ	Most players have trouble reaching 1 point
2015-04-28 07:24:38	boredDev	I'd lose immediately.
2015-04-28 07:24:52	boredDev	I'm so bad SSB
2015-04-28 07:25:17	Tijn	If I ever see SSB for Wii U discounted somewhere, I might think about buying it
2015-04-28 07:25:36	Tijn	But I'm not really attracted to such games
2015-04-28 07:25:50	VDZ	Tijn; unlikely, SSB games always retain their value. Unless you mean '30 euros' as discounted
2015-04-28 07:26:01	Tijn	Well, it's probably 60 euros now, right?
2015-04-28 07:26:11	VDZ	I think 50? But yeah, full price
2015-04-28 07:26:14	%NeiloGD	voxel, may as well have attacked me
2015-04-28 07:26:23	%NeiloGD	I forgot he lived with me for a moment

2015-04-28 07:26:44	boredDev	I can't get my friends on IRC =\
2015-04-28 07:26:48	Wonkyth	VDZ: haha, that sounds sweet :D
2015-04-28 07:26:58	boredDev	I keep trying, but no one spends as much time on the computer as I do.
2015-04-28 07:26:59	voxel	NeiloGD: my reach is infinite. there is nowhere you are safe from the nation of voxel
2015-04-28 07:27:09	boredDev	starting to seem like they're never on computers actually.
2015-04-28 07:27:50	Wonkyth	NeiloGD: lol
2015-04-28 07:28:09	Wonkyth	NeiloGD: might I recommend a trade embargo?
2015-04-28 07:29:06	%NeiloGD	perhaps.

2015-04-28 07:32:43	VDZ	Wait wtf
2015-04-28 07:32:44	Wonkyth	boredDev: it's LITERALLY a waiting game.
2015-04-28 07:33:00	boredDev	dunno. I'm not that good at the game.
2015-04-28 07:33:17	Wonkyth	boredDev: you just sit around with enough defenses to deter people, and then shit artists and stuff
2015-04-28 07:33:24	boredDev	haha

2015-04-28 07:34:55	VDZ	or I
2015-04-28 07:35:06	boredDev	why would you type it?
2015-04-28 07:35:32	Wonkyth	VDZ: wait, you typed that?
2015-04-28 07:35:37	VDZ	Because VNC - the computer I'm watching the video on is not the one I'm sharing the link on. Can't copy-paste
2015-04-28 07:35:43	VDZ	Always have to do that with IRC links
2015-04-28 07:35:52	boredDev	ew
2015-04-28 07:36:05	boredDev	you should figure out a way to not have to do that.
2015-04-28 07:36:10	Wonkyth	VDZ: :o
2015-04-28 07:36:17	Wonkyth	VDZ: get a macro for it
2015-04-28 07:36:56	boredDev	I should stop being lazy and catalog these vects and get back to making my game.
2015-04-28 07:37:10	VDZ	There are ways to avoid that, like running an IRC client locally on the channel, running one connected to the network but not in the channel and PMing myself the link, or pastebinning the link to copy-paste (like I did just now to fix it)
2015-04-28 07:37:18	VDZ	But it's all more trouble than it's worth
2015-04-28 07:38:16	boredDev	I don't really understand your setup, so...
2015-04-28 07:40:41	VDZ	boredDev; http://i.xomf.com/wbfyl.png <-- setup
2015-04-28 07:41:01	boredDev	are they too seperate machines?
2015-04-28 07:41:11	boredDev	I don't get why you can't copy pasta?
2015-04-28 07:41:18	boredDev	two*
2015-04-28 07:41:51	VDZ	Yes. The 'TightVNC viewer' window contains the screen of another machine
2015-04-28 07:42:10	VDZ	(To be precise, it's an X session running on my server)

2015-04-28 07:45:50	boredDev	nothing. don't worry about it.
2015-04-28 07:46:02	boredDev	Wonkyth: rollerblading?
2015-04-28 07:46:09	Wonkyth	boredDev: yeah
2015-04-28 07:46:12	boredDev	why?
2015-04-28 07:46:43	Wonkyth	boredDev: dunno
2015-04-28 07:46:49	boredDev	I also hide my taskbar because I don't like that it takes screen space.
2015-04-28 07:47:07	VDZ	I don't hide my taskbar
2015-04-28 07:47:13	VDZ	But I crop it from screenshot :)
2015-04-28 07:47:42	boredDev	I hide mine. I like to have that extra 30+ pixels of space on my screen
2015-04-28 07:48:11	VDZ	I find instant access to all my running programs more important
2015-04-28 07:48:40	boredDev	I have alt tab for that.
2015-04-28 07:48:59	VDZ	That takes like 10 presses before you get to your program
2015-04-28 07:49:03	VDZ	If you're lucky
2015-04-28 07:49:14	boredDev	Wonkyth: I have a video I'd like to share in relation to your rollerblading thing, but I can't find it.
2015-04-28 07:49:24	Wonkyth	boredDev: :(
2015-04-28 07:49:26	boredDev	I try to limit the number of applications I run.
2015-04-28 07:49:31	VDZ	I currently have 27 things open that I would alt-tab through
2015-04-28 07:49:53	Sk3letor	hmm this AI takes alot of to make..
2015-04-28 07:50:07	Lev	I would limit the number of things I run, but I love writing my own helper tools too much
2015-04-28 07:50:17	boredDev	Wonkyth: slightly unrelated http://i.imgur.com/CCek0MK.jpg
2015-04-28 07:50:48	Wonkyth	boredDev: ? 
2015-04-28 07:50:51	Wonkyth	boredDev: that you?
2015-04-28 07:50:57	boredDev	yea, little over 10 years ago.
2015-04-28 07:51:11	Wonkyth	heh
2015-04-28 07:51:20	boredDev	that skatepark has been torn down, and even if it hadn't I prolly couldn't do that anymore.
2015-04-28 07:51:28	boredDev	miss that park though.
2015-04-28 07:51:35	Wonkyth	I used to do a little BMX, back when my bike was too small to do the humps properly
2015-04-28 07:51:58	Wonkyth	and some rollerblading, but only casually. I just liked to go fast on em.
2015-04-28 07:52:02	boredDev	if you look in the back of that picture you can see a half pipe with stairs. I tried to jump those stairs on blades.
2015-04-28 07:52:19	VDZ	I'm really good at skateboarding. I can get 14 million in one combo on Airport
2015-04-28 07:52:27	boredDev	I landed, but I wasn't confortable with the fall, so I'd always roll out.
2015-04-28 07:52:31	boredDev	like, tumble.
2015-04-28 07:52:50	Wonkyth	VDZ: psh, who can't/
2015-04-28 07:53:23	VDZ	Wonkyth; most players, actually. Even online a lot of players can't, and most players don't even play online
2015-04-28 07:53:43	boredDev	http://imgur.com/9WtviyQ,CDPjsRi I did this to my leg skateboarding. cause I like sharing random pictures.
2015-04-28 07:54:04	Wonkyth	VDZ: wait, which one is this?
2015-04-28 07:54:05	boredDev	VDZ: I like to play skate 3 more than THPS
2015-04-28 07:54:12	VDZ	Wonkyth; THPS3
2015-04-28 07:54:17	Wonkyth	VDZ: ah
2015-04-28 07:54:29	Wonkyth	I haven't played TH since online play was a thing
2015-04-28 07:54:36	Wonkyth	(or at least I never played it online)
2015-04-28 07:54:41	Wonkyth	(again, never owned a console)
2015-04-28 07:54:50	VDZ	I play it on PC
2015-04-28 07:55:17	VDZ	I suck at THPS on consoles...even in American Wasteland I could only get about 1 million in a combo with the gamepad
2015-04-28 07:55:43	boredDev	damn it. I can't remember where that video went!!!

2015-04-28 08:05:14	boredDev	specifically for skateparks.
2015-04-28 08:05:35	boredDev	they ride lower to the ground and have a more balanced designed so they don't wobble as much.
2015-04-28 08:05:45	Wonkyth	koo
2015-04-28 08:05:53	boredDev	plus they have flats next to the wheels for grinding.

2015-04-28 08:09:33	boredDev	you need that balance when landing a hip transfer. can't have your skates wobbling all over when you hit the other side of a 4' quarter pipe.
2015-04-28 08:09:47	Wonkyth	fair enough

2015-04-28 08:10:02	Wonkyth	I guess I never noticed the wobble much
2015-04-28 08:10:06	boredDev	I met a kid at a local bowl park you had those skates.
2015-04-28 08:10:17	boredDev	it's not a bother of flat ground.
2015-04-28 08:10:33	boredDev	but hockey skates are much more responsive to small movements.
2015-04-28 08:10:43	boredDev	bitslap: when is this 5hr jam taking place?

2015-04-28 09:39:47	marcus	I'm reading up on paid modding drama on the internet.
2015-04-28 09:39:57	bitslap	people are basically idiots
2015-04-28 09:40:04	bitslap	modgate
2015-04-28 09:40:23	bitslap	how many modders have complained?
2015-04-28 09:40:29	VDZ	I've heard valid arguments against it
2015-04-28 09:40:32	VDZ	A lot, apparently
2015-04-28 09:40:40	VDZ	It seems it's ESPECIALLY the modding community that's against it
2015-04-28 09:41:19	marcus	The entertainment industry (not just Video Games) is such a strange business. It's hard to wrap oe's head around all the intricacies ...
2015-04-28 09:41:43	bitslap	how much did valve get from a hat in tf2 ?
2015-04-28 09:42:43	marcus	I understand some of the arguments against the system, particularly the requirement of support of a product and protection of a modder's intellectual property from piracy (in that once a mod becomes a paid for product, people will steal it to try and sell parts of it themselves).
2015-04-28 09:43:05	Sk3letor	bitslap: including you too? ;)
2015-04-28 09:43:36	deniska	hm
2015-04-28 09:44:09	Sk3letor	I once bought tf2.. then I lost my hope to it when they later publish it to be free for all + adding more and more useless items like hats/stupid weapons.
2015-04-28 09:44:43	deniska	There is CC license allowing modification and commercial use, I think it'll be suitable for modding world
2015-04-28 09:45:02	deniska	But many modders are too stupid to learn licenses =)
2015-04-28 09:45:05	bitslap	creative commons ?
2015-04-28 09:45:05	marcus	Yes, but who polices it?
2015-04-28 09:45:32	TimBeaudet	Good morning Ludumites! :-)
2015-04-28 09:45:42	 *	deniska remembers one guy who put his mod out under GPL on github with a disclaimer that code is only for looks and you can't use it

2015-04-28 09:46:24	 *	TimBeaudet hides from deniska
2015-04-28 09:47:48	marcus	It's one thing to apply a license to your work. It's another entirely to keep track of usage and eforce that license.
2015-04-28 09:48:10	marcus	s/eforce/enforce
2015-04-28 09:50:54	marcus	TimBeaudet, I read that as "Luddites" and wondered how you knew so much about me! :P
2015-04-28 09:51:07	VDZ	Wow, looks like Valve stopped offering paid mods for Skyrim
2015-04-28 09:51:10	VDZ	Protesters win
2015-04-28 09:51:31	VDZ	marcus; that's why you should apply cc0 to all of your works, easiest to enforce
2015-04-28 09:52:08	marcus	VDZ: This is true. Then, you simply have to rely on people donating to you for your good, hard work, right?
2015-04-28 09:54:58	Twiner	deniska: thats fine
2015-04-28 09:55:01	Twiner	GPL is stupid anywys

2015-04-28 10:40:50	Sk3letor	voxel: what was the point of your questions?
2015-04-28 10:41:16	Uhfgood	i also have to consider screen layout

2015-04-28 10:42:45	Uhfgood	also in some of these games, the enemies when you leave them too long (for instance when the animals go back into the pipes in mario brothers and come back out at the top, and then when the monsters in bubble bobble are left in the bubbles too long) they get angry and then move a lot faster
2015-04-28 10:42:53	Uhfgood	So that's definitely going to be an aspect
2015-04-28 10:43:10	Uhfgood	so basically to get the highest points possible, you need to hypnotize them, and then shove them into the box

2015-04-28 14:14:29	vede	Well, yeah it's in the same vein as System Shock and Bioshock etc.

2015-04-28 15:40:18	rnlf	i am conflicted. should i update to sid right away or wait with breaking the system until i need something that's not available in jessie?
2015-04-28 15:40:19	rxi	Sheepolution, then you have __newindex for setting rather than getting a field
2015-04-28 15:40:23	bitslap	drnick: what is simple?
2015-04-28 15:40:27	rnlf	i guess now is a better time

2015-04-28 15:42:08	rxi	Sheepolution, additionally, if __index is a table, it'll return the value of that field in the __index table if it doesn't exist (thats how inheritance tends to work)
2015-04-28 15:42:44	rnlf	Mate is soooo good
2015-04-28 15:42:45	Sheepolution	Right so that's why you do obj.__index  = obj
2015-04-28 15:42:49	rnlf	just like the good old gnome 2
2015-04-28 15:43:00	rnlf	:'-)
2015-04-28 15:43:00	rxi	Sheepolution, but its really cool, for example, for my LD entry I had a table which acted as a proxy to another table, and set it up so any field access would automatically dump the table to t he disk, so if you did x.test = 20, it'd set .test to 20 and also save the table to the disk automatically
2015-04-28 15:44:11	Sheepolution	rxi: What do you mean to the disk?

2015-04-28 15:45:30	rxi	Sheepolution, so I just kept my games persistant state in this one table, and whenever it changed it'd automatically save, and then at the start of the game I would load the table -- which is why my game continues where it left off, because it was like, zero effort to add

2015-04-28 16:48:15	rnlf	interestingly, emscripten on debian has exactly the same problem as on ubuntu
2015-04-28 16:48:30	rxi	rnlf, yeh. No part of it assumes a specific byte order, all pixel access is per-byte
2015-04-28 16:48:45	rxi	like each channel is accessed through the struct

2015-04-28 16:52:04	rxi	rnlf, also drawing rotated images needs improving, and bilinear filtering on rotated images doesn't really work, and I think theres a bug in the triangle drawing somewhere, like certain triangles won't connect pixel-perfect at the edge with triangles where they should
2015-04-28 16:52:07	rnlf	ReactorScram, no, it's a model driven software development system

2015-05-10 19:46:09	Wonkyth	Schoenberg's experimentation included stuff like music that doesn't revolve around a tonal centre or key
2015-05-10 19:46:19	LiamLime	I watched a performance of it on youtube - a performance that aired on BBC
2015-05-10 19:46:22	Wonkyth	free atonality was one of his major accomplishments
2015-05-10 19:46:24	LiamLime	It was genuinely amazing
2015-05-10 19:46:33	LiamLime	All the same etiquette applies
2015-05-10 19:46:39	LiamLime	But with no music
2015-05-10 19:47:00	Wonkyth	LiamLime: If you find that interesting, look into Cage's work

2015-05-10 20:23:45	drnick	it just happens that the angle she picked, together with a period of 360, makes a good combination for a RNG

2015-05-10 20:33:05	LiamLime	What is the latest hotness in linux btw?
2015-05-10 20:33:13	drnick	4chan is 44.45% racism and 44.45% calling people autistic
2015-05-10 20:33:14	LiamLime	which distribution do people use?
2015-05-10 20:33:43	LiamLime	Last time I used linux everyone used Ubuntu and SUSE :D
2015-05-10 20:33:43	Jeviny	Daily reminder that not all of 4chan is /b/
2015-05-10 20:34:21	LiamLime	All of 4chan is too racist, sexist and generally unfunny for me, even if it isn't all /b/ :D
2015-05-10 20:34:41	Jeviny	The racism/sexism is easy to pass off honestly
2015-05-10 20:34:46	Jeviny	it's just people trying to be edgy
2015-05-10 20:34:52	LiamLime	I don't judge people who go there tho. I hosted a /tg/ based community for a long time
2015-05-10 20:34:53	Jeviny	I only go there for porn

2015-05-10 20:35:24	iFire	it's awesome
2015-05-10 20:35:27	iFire	and I run unreal engine 4 on it
2015-05-10 20:35:33	Jeviny	/g/ is a mess but in a good way. It's like that 'special' kid you know who's so dumb that they're actually kinda loveable
2015-05-10 20:35:43	LiamLime	What's it like compared to Ubuntu?
2015-05-10 20:36:04	LiamLime	I'm guessing we're both familiar with Ubuntu - most linux people tend to be :D
2015-05-10 20:36:14	drnick	Jeviny, there is lots of racism and autism calling in every board
2015-05-10 20:36:16	Jeviny	I run Lubuntu on my laptops

2015-05-10 20:36:45	Jeviny	well you just said it
2015-05-10 20:36:47	Jeviny	so you're edgy
2015-05-10 20:36:48	iFire	LiamLime: it is ubuntu ;)
2015-05-10 20:36:51	Wonkyth	I'm edgy

2015-05-10 20:36:56	iFire	I mean the software packages are all from ubuntu.
2015-05-10 20:36:57	drnick	I go to 4chan for the funny gifs
2015-05-10 20:37:00	drnick	and webms
2015-05-10 20:37:08	drnick	specially the ALLAHU AKBAR ones
2015-05-10 20:37:08	Jeviny	Rekt threads and porn are all one can really go there for
2015-05-10 20:37:09	Wonkyth	not to be confused with ecchi
2015-05-10 20:37:09	iFire	LiamLime: they just rewrote the front end
2015-05-10 20:37:13	Jeviny	/g/ is my primary source for tech news
2015-05-10 20:37:23	Wonkyth	Don't push me
2015-05-10 20:37:29	Wonkyth	Cos I'm close to the Ech
2015-05-10 20:37:49	Jeviny	and /lgbt/ is just like /g/: It's filled with people so fucking stupid that you almost sorta love them because they're 'special'
2015-05-10 20:37:52	iFire	LiamLime: I think this has a corky script http://lmelinux.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2014/07/elementary-freya-screenshot.png
2015-05-10 20:37:59	Jeviny	It still amazes me that /lgbt/ and /pol/ can exist on the same site
2015-05-10 20:38:03	LiamLime	iFire Has Ubuntu become any more user friendly in the last 5 tears or so? Specifically for the average person. When I stopped using it, it had just gone through a massive overhaul in design and made huge headway in UX design.
2015-05-10 20:38:08	drnick	what is a good editor for Assembly?
2015-05-10 20:38:15	drnick	no weird Linux shit plz
2015-05-10 20:38:15	LiamLime	But then the progress sort of slowed again
2015-05-10 20:38:24	iFire	LiamLime: I forced my parents to use ubuntu...
2015-05-10 20:38:29	drnick	by which I mean emacs/vi and their spawn

2015-05-10 20:38:42	LiamLime	drnick WinIDEA or IAR Embedded Workstation
2015-05-10 20:38:43	Jeviny	drnick: Install gentoo and use vim

2015-05-10 20:39:03	drnick	I specifically said no vi/emacs and spawn
2015-05-10 20:39:08	iFire	drnick: it's a gui..

2015-05-10 20:53:38	Jeviny	That ruins the point though
2015-05-10 20:53:51	Jeviny	the idea is that other people come up with ideas and then I put them in a poll so they can vote on what I should make next
2015-05-10 20:54:01	keeyai	I want that
2015-05-10 20:54:06	keeyai	although I have plenty of ideas for the list
2015-05-10 20:54:07	ForSpareParts	Unity folks, what are you doing for particle collision in 2D? people are saying that you have to make a 3D collider for everything, which… like… I *could* do that, but it sure seems stupid.

2015-05-10 20:55:01	Jeviny	I cooould try that
2015-05-10 20:55:07	Bcadren	You can do a collider manually, you know. it's not that much trouble...long as you aren't talking about thousands of particles; OR needing to collide with EACH OTHER as well as the walls.
2015-05-10 20:55:08	ForSpareParts	keeyai: No 2D-specific particle systems. You use the same functionality as 3D. Which would be fine, but unfortunately there’s no collision…

2015-05-10 20:57:04	Jeviny	Well, I'm not expecting anything from you guys/gals. I'm just saying that it's fun to kinda toss them around.
2015-05-10 20:57:16	Jeviny	Why do you expect people to give LD their ideas during the theme vote?
2015-05-10 20:57:17	Bcadren	Ok. Easiest solution is to make your own particles instead of the default (have them be sprite or quad objects with the particle texture on them). Give them 2D physics colliders and rigidbodies, make them destroy themselves on time out etc.
2015-05-10 20:57:30	Jeviny	Rather the theme suggestions, i mean
2015-05-10 20:57:45	Bcadren	AND put them on their own layer; making them ignore collisions with items on that layer; but not with other objects.
2015-05-10 20:57:47	Bcadren	That's the easy way
2015-05-10 20:58:06	ForSpareParts	Bcadren: hm, alright. Shame I can’t use Shuriken; it seems cool.

2015-05-10 21:00:08	Bcadren	Well if you wanted to use Shuriken the solution is the opposite (give all normal geometry 3D colliders too; since Shuriken uses 3D)...then have all the normal objects ignore 3D collisions so the 2D collisions act as normal.
2015-05-10 21:00:18	drnick	more like <1000

Emergency (life-sustaining) treatment, primarily because of thoracic trauma and shock, was required in 37% of the cats. Nonemergency treatment was required in an additional 30%. The remaining 30% were observed, but did not require treatment. Ninety percent of the treated cats survived.

High-rise syndrome was more frequent during the warmer period of the year. 96.5% of the presented cats, survived after the fall. 46.2% of cats had fractured limbs; 38.5% of fractures were of the forelimb, 61.5% of the hindlimb. The tibia was fractured most often (36.4%), 
2015-05-10 21:22:05	drnick	followed by the femur (23.6%). 78.6% of femoral fractures were distal. The mean age of patients with femoral fractures was 9.1 months, and with tibial fractures 29.2 months. Thoracic trauma was diagnosed in 33.6% of cats. Pneumothorax was diagnosed in 20% of cats, and pulmonary contusions in 13.4%. Falls from the seventh or higher stories, are associated with more severe injuries and with a higher incidence of thoracic trauma.

2015-05-10 21:32:04	LiamLime	Arcade or realistic?

2015-05-10 21:32:36	TimBeaudetPC	LiamLime: realistic, but the first game will be more arcade for simplifications.

2015-05-10 21:52:03	TimBeaudetPC	drnick: I agree with all those points, RTTI isn't that awful to use though, in my experiences.
2015-05-10 21:52:26	LiamLime	In effect prototypes and instatntiable functions in JS act as classes
2015-05-10 21:52:54	LiamLime	Whether they fit the strictest of definition for them is not important to me

2015-05-10 21:53:27	drnick	LiamLime, except you don't need them to define an object
2015-05-10 21:53:40	drnick	and they themselves are objects
2015-05-10 21:53:52	drnick	and things can be freely cast
2015-05-10 21:53:59	LiamLime	You can use them as a class
2015-05-10 21:53:59	drnick	and what is the most important feature,
2015-05-10 21:54:02	LiamLime	That is all that matters to me

2015-05-10 21:54:20	drnick	instances can be individually extended
2015-05-10 21:55:07	LiamLime	drnick, you CAN use them as a class, and I think it's a fair way to think about them when applying classic OOP terminology to javascript
2015-05-10 21:55:20	drnick	OOP != classes
2015-05-10 21:55:54	LiamLime	Why does this bother you so much?

2015-05-11 02:14:08	ArcticSupernova	bit of a noob question, but does ludum dare support GameMaker Games
2015-05-11 02:14:21	medice	I'm conflicted as what I would like to do is an adventure game but doing it indie is buttload of work per gameplay hour and it's a niche genre too
2015-05-11 02:14:52	ArcticSupernova	yeah, my compromise for that is to make a little bit of adventure, but mostly make it  a platformer PVE brawler
2015-05-11 02:17:01	euske	Many participants in LD made GameMaker games as far as I know

2015-05-11 02:22:42	+bitslap	studio
2015-05-11 02:22:44	Mario	it usually is
2015-05-11 02:22:58	Mario	but might depend on your windows version as well and where you've bought it
2015-05-11 02:23:07	medice	well, 8.1 to be precise
2015-05-11 02:23:22	euske	hm, I need to cluster this 5G of dataset with only 1G of memory.
2015-05-11 02:23:27	ArcticSupernova	i am now tending towards developing in 8 and then porting to studio for export
2015-05-11 02:23:44	medice	but I guess I can test it out anyway from boot since it won't start rewriting the drive before inserting license key
2015-05-11 02:23:46	ArcticSupernova	because i've noticed the compile time is about 5 times longer in studio that 8, but has better runtime performance

2015-05-11 02:36:44	BurritoEclair	From what I can tell it's a lot more of implimenting stuff and less actual creation. But, it's a huge step up from my current jobs.
2015-05-11 02:37:08	+bitslap	whats ur current?
2015-05-11 02:37:10	BurritoEclair	It'd pay more than both of them and I'd get weekends off.

2015-05-14 09:37:28	Aelloon	what do you guys think
2015-05-14 09:37:33	Aelloon	is it fair to call beta games beta nowadays?
2015-05-14 09:37:43	Aelloon	i think when a game starts making money is when you should consider it a released game
2015-05-14 09:37:50	Aelloon	calling beta seems wrong
2015-05-14 09:38:56	FakeYou	you could argue that aslong as the game isn't feature complete than its still in beta
2015-05-14 09:39:10	Aelloon	so it's okay that
2015-05-14 09:39:14	Aelloon	developers just call their game beta
2015-05-14 09:39:17	Aelloon	while making money off of it
2015-05-14 09:39:17	>	dusakus has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-14 09:39:28	Aelloon	and then when somebody brings up an issue they go "lol it's just beta"
2015-05-14 09:39:33	Aelloon	(or players in defense of the game)
2015-05-14 09:39:40	Tijn	Yeah, remember Minecraft? Notch made a ton of money when the game was in alpha and beta
2015-05-14 09:39:51	Tijn	Clearly those versions were very different from the final thing
2015-05-14 09:39:57	Aelloon	and then the stuff that was promised never actually got implemented
2015-05-14 09:40:14	Aelloon	you do realize this leads us to more of dayz type crap right?
2015-05-14 09:40:18	Aelloon	where a game is in beta for years
2015-05-14 09:40:24	Aelloon	and will probably die before it gets out of beta
2015-05-14 09:40:44	Tijn	Well, you dont have to buy it, right?
2015-05-14 09:40:54	FakeYou	I think buying a game in beta or alpha is more about supporting the development than actually buying a product
2015-05-14 09:40:55	Aelloon	the point isn't "you have to buy it"
2015-05-14 09:40:59	FakeYou	or atleast, thats what it should be
2015-05-14 09:41:04	Aelloon	if a game makes money
2015-05-14 09:41:08	Aelloon	it isn't a beta test anymore
2015-05-14 09:41:11	Tijn	And you can still call out a developer if he's clearly abusing
2015-05-14 09:41:28	Tijn	Beta isn't necessarily a beta test
2015-05-14 09:41:32	Tijn	It just means the game is not finished
2015-05-14 09:41:42	Aelloon	so is WoW a beta?
2015-05-14 09:41:44	Aelloon	and runescape?
2015-05-14 09:41:48	Aelloon	game's been out 14 years
2015-05-14 09:41:50	Aelloon	still not finished!
2015-05-14 09:42:10	Tijn	It's just a label, really
2015-05-14 09:42:31	Aelloon	of course and the label is associated with "this isn't the final product, it'll get better"
2015-05-14 09:42:36	Tijn	Yeah
2015-05-14 09:42:38	Aelloon	but is it really okay for the developer to profit during that time?
2015-05-14 09:42:42	Tijn	Why not?
2015-05-14 09:42:47	Aelloon	just call it beta
2015-05-14 09:42:51	Aelloon	and all yoru sins are excused
2015-05-14 09:43:04	Aelloon	then when it doesn't do that well just abandon it because eh
2015-05-14 09:43:32	Aelloon	i mean you already made the money so why bother continuing to develop it
2015-05-14 09:43:54	FakeYou	its the same issues are preorders isn't it?
2015-05-14 09:44:25	Tijn	I dont think there's really a lot wrong with all this
2015-05-14 09:44:42	Tijn	If people are willing to pay for promises, they know they're taking a risk
2015-05-14 09:44:53	Aelloon	?!?!?!?
2015-05-14 09:45:01	Aelloon	i'm talking about whether having the excuse of "beta" is okay
2015-05-14 09:45:04	Aelloon	if you're making a profit
2015-05-14 09:45:08	Aelloon	in my book it clearly isn't
2015-05-14 09:45:15	Aelloon	if you're making money your game is released
2015-05-14 09:45:27	Tijn	That's a very old school way of thinking, Aelloon 
2015-05-14 09:45:40	Tijn	The label "beta" just says something about the developer's mindset
2015-05-14 09:45:44	Aelloon	but you guys seem to think that hey anything goes
2015-05-14 09:45:59	Aelloon	attach all the labels that help you deceive the customer to your product
2015-05-14 09:46:03	Aelloon	since that's just the best
2015-05-14 09:46:15	Tijn	How is it deceiving to call something beta?
2015-05-14 09:46:23	Tijn	It's deceiving *not* to call it beta
2015-05-14 09:46:34	Aelloon	because you're SELLING it
2015-05-14 09:46:37	>	oldtopman has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-14 09:46:49	Tijn	So what if the same not finished crappy thing was sold, but without the beta label
2015-05-14 09:46:52	Tijn	Then it would be alright?
2015-05-14 09:47:01	Aelloon	you can't sell unfinished products elsewhere
2015-05-14 09:47:05	Aelloon	with the label that it's not finished
2015-05-14 09:47:13	Aelloon	only in some circumstances can you do that
2015-05-14 09:47:49	Tijn	I think it's a good thing that people can support development of a game by buying it beforehand
2015-05-14 09:48:03	Aelloon	okay then
2015-05-14 09:48:11	Aelloon	i guess then we have a difference in opinion
2015-05-14 09:48:15	Tijn	I guess so :P
2015-05-14 09:48:17	Aelloon	hope you enjoy all those games that stay unfinished
2015-05-14 09:48:20	Aelloon	and those day1 DLCs
2015-05-14 09:48:58	Tijn	I dont buy a lot of beta / early access games, precisely because of the reasons you are mentioning
2015-05-14 09:49:07	Tijn	But if other people do want to money for it, I'm not stopping them

2015-05-14 09:49:43	Aelloon	but these arguments don't really work
2015-05-14 09:49:47	Aelloon	on the whole you want to have protection
2015-05-14 09:49:57	Tijn	Why do people need protection?
2015-05-14 09:49:58	Aelloon	if there are nefarious enough issues that go on
2015-05-14 09:49:59	>	PizzaPortal has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-14 09:50:04	Aelloon	because people can be deceived
2015-05-14 09:50:17	Aelloon	we don't go "oh, i don't engage in slavery, but i think other people should be able to if they want to"
2015-05-14 09:50:25	Tijn	How are people deceived if the developer is saying the product isn't finished?
2015-05-14 09:50:40	Tijn	People who pay money for such things know what they're getting into
2015-05-14 09:50:46	Aelloon	because it encourages scenarios
2015-05-14 09:50:49	Aelloon	where a developer won't finish his game
2015-05-14 09:50:50	Aelloon	ever
2015-05-14 09:50:55	Norgg	Aelloon: Eh, I prefer to be able to buy things and try them out early on even if they're not finished.
2015-05-14 09:50:57	Aelloon	or he just calls whatever they have and say it's done
2015-05-14 09:51:16	Tijn	I really dont think its a big deal, Aelloon 
2015-05-14 09:51:20	Norgg	Although I actually prefer Kickstarter/Patreon as a model for that than Steam Early Access.
2015-05-14 09:51:27	Tijn	If a developer wants to be a dick like that, he wont have a very lasting career in the games industry anyway
2015-05-14 09:51:40	Aelloon	really?
2015-05-14 09:52:00	Aelloon	*minecraft* did *NOT* deliver on the promises
2015-05-14 09:52:10	Aelloon	that people were led to believe were going to be in the final game

2015-05-14 09:52:16	trashcant	What did minecraft promise? I forget.
2015-05-14 09:52:39	trashcant	I remember a piece of text saying "you're buing the game as it is now and future updates are bonus"
2015-05-14 09:53:20	Tijn	Yeah, and people who bought the alpha/beta paid a lot less than the final price
2015-05-14 09:53:31	Tijn	All in all I haven't heard about a lot of complaints about Minecraft at all
2015-05-14 09:53:55	Norgg	They kind of screwed up with the promises of sorting out a modding API.
2015-05-14 09:54:05	Norgg	That's the main complaint I've heard.
2015-05-14 09:54:15	Tijn	There are loads of mods for MC though, right?

2015-05-14 09:54:48	Norgg	Like the Bukkit team had to reverse engineer obfuscated Java.
2015-05-14 09:54:54	Norgg	Which must have been /fun/.
2015-05-14 09:55:33	Aelloon	i have a hard time finding a list
2015-05-14 09:55:35	Aelloon	since it was 5 years ago
2015-05-14 09:55:43	Tijn	I believe you, Aelloon 
2015-05-14 09:55:49	Aelloon	and i never cared much for minecraft precisely for this reason
2015-05-14 09:55:57	Aelloon	but they did DDOS minecraft over it
2015-05-14 09:55:59	trashcant	Where did lanterns go? Halloween update promises didn't deliver.
2015-05-14 09:55:59	Aelloon	for quite a while
2015-05-14 09:56:00	Tijn	It's still that I think it's the people's own responsibility
2015-05-14 09:56:00	Norgg	http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Mentioned_features#Workbench_.28Plugin_API.29

2015-05-14 09:56:33	Norgg	Probably the most value I've got out of a game.

2015-05-14 09:59:17	Norgg	Early Access is not a dirty word, it's made so clear what you're paying for and that Things Might Change.

2015-05-14 09:59:59	Norgg	If you want to wait until a full release that's fine and if you want to advise other people to wait too that's also fine.
2015-05-14 10:00:28	Norgg	But please don't ask people not to put things out on Early Access because I quite like them being available.
2015-05-14 10:00:31	MbccompanyX	If i can tell my opinion, Early Access seems more like a scam....
2015-05-14 10:00:53	Norgg	MbccompanyX: It's /potentially/ a /tiny bit of a scam/.
2015-05-14 10:00:55	MbccompanyX	I mean, people srs wants a game so early knowing that could be incomplete and full of bugs?
2015-05-14 10:01:10	Norgg	Yes, definitely, I love trying things out early despite potential bugs.
2015-05-14 10:01:11	Tijn	Every business is potentially a scam
2015-05-14 10:01:28	Norgg	MbccompanyX: This is #ludumdare ffs!
2015-05-14 10:01:40	Tijn	Early Access is very clear about what it is
2015-05-14 10:01:53	Norgg	We've just made over a thousand games full of goddamn bugs and put them out there. :P

2015-05-14 10:02:36	MbccompanyX	Norgg.... Maybe you are overlooking something
2015-05-14 10:03:11	MbccompanyX	The games on Early Access are maked from only the dev knows
2015-05-14 10:03:25	MbccompanyX	while the game maked during the ludum dare are maked on 48/72 hours
2015-05-14 10:03:33	Tijn	Nuclear Throne made over a million bucks while being still in Early Access
2015-05-14 10:03:39	Tijn	There's clearly a market for this kind of stuff
2015-05-14 10:03:44	MbccompanyX	so i can understand better bugs about a LudumDare game
2015-05-14 10:03:46	Tijn	So why not let the people have what they want?
2015-05-14 10:03:51	MbccompanyX	but not on a Early Access game

2015-05-14 10:04:50	Norgg	MbccompanyX: I'm not overlooking that at all. Sure Ludum Dare games are made faster, but it's the same principal. I prefer people to be open about development and make things available early, as a consumer.
2015-05-14 10:04:53	MbccompanyX	Just to remain on the topic of the room
2015-05-14 10:05:01	Tijn	I dont mind a bug here and there to be honest. As long as I'm not losing hours of progress all the freaking time, I'm willing to cope with a lot of glitches and other minor things
2015-05-14 10:05:09	Norgg	As a developer I understand it's not always the best choice for a given team.
2015-05-14 10:05:14	Norgg	But for some it is.
2015-05-14 10:05:53	Norgg	Like for Nuclear Throne and Gangbeasts it's *definitely* been the right choice and *definitely* not a scam.
2015-05-14 10:05:53	MbccompanyX	So... Nobody is already trying to make a strategy for Ludum Dare 33 seems.... well i can understand because there are still 99 days....
2015-05-14 10:06:08	Tijn	Exactly Norgg - it's the transparency that's a huge added value, for both the consumer as well as the dev
2015-05-14 10:06:11	FARTRON	99 - 33 = 66
2015-05-14 10:06:14	Norgg	They're games which have a few bugs, aren't finished, are clearly marked as early access, and are still fun as hell.

2015-05-14 10:09:20	MbccompanyX	i noticed that some games didn't received a review
2015-05-14 10:09:23	MbccompanyX	is that normal?
2015-05-14 10:09:29	Tijn	Not a single one?

2015-05-14 10:13:04	MbccompanyX	Anyway back at what i told at first, nobody is already planning a schedule for LD33?
2015-05-14 10:13:18	Norgg	Aelloon: Actually, quick question I'm honestly curious about the oppion of from an Early Access sceptic: do you think is releasing a buggy mess of a game as Early Access more or less of scam than releasing a buggy mess of a game as a final release?
2015-05-14 10:13:30	<	frnknstn ha salido (Success)
2015-05-14 10:13:59	MbccompanyX	Norgg you saw what happened to a game called Ultimate Arena?
2015-05-14 10:14:06	Aelloon	Norgg, it depends on the future
2015-05-14 10:14:10	Aelloon	if you're going to fix it then yes
2015-05-14 10:14:13	Aelloon	early access is better
2015-05-14 10:14:17	Aelloon	if you aren't then final is better
2015-05-14 10:14:25	Norgg	k, yeah, makes sense.
2015-05-14 10:14:30	Aelloon	if we're going overall then i'd like to think a little more on it which side would win out
2015-05-14 10:14:37	Norgg	MbccompanyX: Nah, not seen that one. Something that's just lingered in Early Access?
2015-05-14 10:14:56	MbccompanyX	Norgg not really.... is a bit a long story
2015-05-14 10:15:10	MbccompanyX	The game was maked by a hated youtuber called Zeb89

2015-05-14 10:15:21	Jeviny	Mornin*
2015-05-14 10:15:29	MbccompanyX	He and another one were making the game
2015-05-14 10:15:41	MbccompanyX	even if Zeb89 was a cheater on some MP games
2015-05-14 10:15:44	Jeviny	jambalaya is best dev fuel
2015-05-14 10:15:52	MbccompanyX	Only to get in the "Alpha" he asked 20 Euro
2015-05-14 10:16:09	MbccompanyX	After less of 2 months all the traces of the game disappear
2015-05-14 10:16:31	MbccompanyX	For what Zeb89 told, the dev escaped to Spain with the money
2015-05-14 10:16:47	MbccompanyX	but.... Strange fact: The dev appeared from nowhere
2015-05-14 10:16:55	MbccompanyX	and disappeared like how it appeared
2015-05-14 10:17:07	MbccompanyX	For what i know he took over 20k euro
2015-05-14 10:17:33	MbccompanyX	And Zeb89 refuse to give a refund even because.... The whole game was instead the SDK of Unity!
2015-05-14 10:18:07	MbccompanyX	so....
2015-05-14 10:18:13	MbccompanyX	Any opinion about this Norgg?
2015-05-14 10:18:36	Tijn	People should be hesitant when paying an unknown dev money for something that's not finished
2015-05-14 10:18:46	Norgg	Yeah, okay, sounds like that's just plain fraud and he should probably get sued.

2015-05-14 10:19:01	MbccompanyX	And about Zeb89 there is more to add.....
2015-05-14 10:19:17	MbccompanyX	He maked a hidden script for a stolen mod he claimed as own
2015-05-14 10:19:24	MbccompanyX	That disable AdBlock
2015-05-14 10:19:34	MbccompanyX	But without giving a message to the user
2015-05-14 10:19:45	Norgg	I'm curious about what's going to happen with yogventures myself.
2015-05-14 10:19:48	MbccompanyX	Why all this? Because he complained about low earning

2015-05-19 12:35:50	pekuja	ok yeah probably that
2015-05-19 12:36:06	sir_garbagetruck	I get confused here (Helsinki) because I keep trying to apply it to a grid
2015-05-19 12:36:15	sir_garbagetruck	having grown up where everything is on a grid
2015-05-19 12:36:21	sir_garbagetruck	Helsinki is not on a grid (:
2015-05-19 12:37:38	pekuja	sir_garbagetruck: you're a demoscener, right? I don't remember seeing you around here on #ludumdare before
2015-05-19 12:38:13	sir_garbagetruck	I've participated in the last ... 6. But yeah, I've normally not been about "weeks after"
2015-05-19 12:38:20	sir_garbagetruck	hmm no, the last 9... on and off.
2015-05-19 12:38:23	sir_garbagetruck	and yes. Demoscener.
2015-05-19 12:39:05	pekuja	I think I talked to you at Assembly last year. I was seated near you and you were doing a radio show
2015-05-19 12:39:17	sir_garbagetruck	Yep. You were across the way, right?
2015-05-19 12:39:18	sir_garbagetruck	erm
2015-05-19 12:39:20	sir_garbagetruck	table.
2015-05-19 12:39:21	sir_garbagetruck	(:
2015-05-19 12:39:33	pekuja	yeah I think so
2015-05-19 12:39:56	shinD	people talking about oulu, whoa
2015-05-19 12:39:58	sir_garbagetruck	I'll be there again, should be same spot.
2015-05-19 12:40:10	pekuja	haha, cool
2015-05-19 12:40:51	shinD	but oulu is a strange city in many ways, yes
2015-05-19 12:40:55	shinD	and i've never heard of Rili
2015-05-19 12:40:56	pekuja	I don't have a ticket yet. I'm not sure I'm going to get a computer seat anyhow since I'm expecting to be super busy with work stuff, so might even be working over the weekend
2015-05-19 12:41:01	@the31	Does anyone have a checklist to getting something on screen with modern OpenGL? I've done it before but I'm missing something this time and can't figure out what.

2015-05-19 12:41:27	Cryovat	Hey, you have pyramids
2015-05-19 12:41:32	@Sol_HSA	the31: I use "opengl 4.0 shading language cookbook" as the checklist
2015-05-19 12:41:57	sir_garbagetruck	pekuja: ok cool. Do that - I'm not really sure how many folks will be "inside" anyway, and some folks will be in Germany at Evoke
2015-05-19 12:42:13	@the31	Sol_HSA: Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
2015-05-19 12:42:33	@the31	Also looks like a cool thing to have. :D
2015-05-19 12:42:38	pekuja	sir_garbagetruck: oh, it's at the same time? actually now that you mention it I think there was some hubbub about that
2015-05-19 12:43:15	pekuja	shinD: Rili http://rili.fi/
2015-05-19 12:43:29	pekuja	shinD: the company is from Oulu so I figured it might be only available near there
2015-05-19 12:43:38	sir_garbagetruck	yeah. ORIGINALLY it wasn't. Evoke was a week before. Then Assembly moved - mainly pressure from the "professional gaming leagues"
2015-05-19 12:44:02	sir_garbagetruck	oh, THAT stuff. I have NEVER seen that.
2015-05-19 12:44:12	sir_garbagetruck	but I keep reading that "we drink it all the time in Finland"
2015-05-19 12:44:31	ahimsa	We do.
2015-05-19 12:44:52	Cryovat	That
2015-05-19 12:45:03	Cryovat	That's what I'm going to tell my coworkers too when the bottle I ordered arrives :D
2015-05-19 12:45:05	sir_garbagetruck	I guarantee if I go to any of the 4 stores within 500m of my house, none will have it (:
2015-05-19 12:45:13	sir_garbagetruck	(and I'm in kallio)
2015-05-19 12:45:34	pekuja	haha
2015-05-19 12:46:01	shinD	this is actually the first time i've heard of that stuff, but i don't really drink sodas so
2015-05-19 12:46:03	pekuja	yeah, I looked in some stores in the center-ish and couldn't find any
2015-05-19 12:46:17	shinD	even if it is from around here, so that's funny
2015-05-19 12:46:21	pekuja	shinD: yeah I only heard of it a few days ago
2015-05-19 12:46:59	>	RyanNielson has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-19 12:46:59	pekuja	I like sodas, and it sounds like a funny concept
2015-05-19 12:47:18	pekuja	could even be legitimate delicious, but mostly I'm just interested in it for the novelty
2015-05-19 12:47:23	shinD	maybe i'll try some next time i need to get groceries
2015-05-19 12:47:29	shinD	i'll probably forget though :p
2015-05-19 12:47:33	sir_garbagetruck	I would totally try it if I found it, I tend to try any drink that comes out.
2015-05-19 12:48:21	sir_garbagetruck	which is why I'm pissed that they stopped making coffeed battery...
2015-05-19 12:48:28	Cryovat	Hhe
2015-05-19 12:48:35	sir_garbagetruck	and can't believe that we still can buy "spam"
2015-05-19 12:48:40	Cryovat	Ten years later, I still mourn the loss of Vanilla Coke :(
2015-05-19 12:48:41	sir_garbagetruck	because it's NOT pink.
2015-05-19 12:48:45	pekuja	haha :D
2015-05-19 12:48:53	sir_garbagetruck	I _have_ seen Vanilla Coke here.  Occasionally.
2015-05-19 12:48:54	pekuja	might be a bit disgusting if Spam was pink
2015-05-19 12:49:07	sir_garbagetruck	well, of course it would be disgusting, but that would be the point (:
2015-05-19 12:49:19	Cryovat	They sell imported Vanilla Coke now, but it tastes different than the Norwegian version :(
2015-05-19 12:49:35	pekuja	yeah actually just the other day I was in Alepa and they had Vanilla Coke. it even said "new product", so perhaps it is time for Vanilla Coke in Helsinki now
2015-05-19 12:49:39	pekuja	keep an eye out
2015-05-19 12:49:43	sir_garbagetruck	yeah, well, you DO win... you have 'Urge' there

2015-05-19 12:50:17	Cryovat	I'll see it in the store and can't remember what it tastes
2015-05-19 12:50:32	Cryovat	So I'll buy a bottle, think "oh right, it tastes like this"

2015-05-19 12:50:40	pekuja	speaking of sodas, I recently got a free SodaStream from a friend who stopped using it
2015-05-19 12:51:26	sir_garbagetruck	pekuja: ok the 1 euro sodastream flavorings you can find at, well, some places (like the K market at Ruohalahti)
2015-05-19 12:51:27	Cryovat	Reminds me I need to replace the gas container on mine
2015-05-19 12:51:40	sir_garbagetruck	they aren't that bad.  Probably horrible for you (:
2015-05-19 12:51:58	pekuja	1-euro? sounds cheaper than the normal ones
2015-05-19 12:51:58	ahimsa	Cryovat: what loss of vanilla coke?
2015-05-19 12:52:02	pekuja	why are they 1 euro?
2015-05-19 12:52:10	sir_garbagetruck	because they are not by the same company (:
2015-05-19 12:52:18	sir_garbagetruck	they are by... hang on. I'll go see (:
2015-05-19 12:52:19	pekuja	oh, I see :P
2015-05-19 12:52:20	Cryovat	ahimsa: It failed in Norway a decade ago
2015-05-19 12:52:32	ahimsa	Cryovat: right, I usually buy it these days when I want a coke :)
2015-05-19 12:52:33	Cryovat	I just use my Sodastream machine for carbonated water
2015-05-19 12:52:45	ahimsa	Which is like once a month tops that I buy a soda.
2015-05-19 12:52:46	pekuja	hah, it seems like everybody has a Sodastream :D
2015-05-19 12:52:58	Cryovat	Amounts to about 30 euro cents for a liter
2015-05-19 12:53:09	pekuja	like honestly, since I got it I talk about it with people occasionally and it seems like everybody I mention it to already has one :D
2015-05-19 12:53:17	shinD	i don't!
2015-05-19 12:53:21	pekuja	but I guess it was kind of a hit at one point, but people just stopped talking about it
2015-05-19 12:53:27	ahimsa	ps. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COGmRYA-eV4
2015-05-19 12:53:28	shinD	my sister has one, i guess that's worth 1/2 of a point
2015-05-19 12:53:34	pekuja	haha :D
2015-05-19 12:53:40	pekuja	they have a few flavors that I like
2015-05-19 12:53:42	Cryovat	They're pretty cheap these days
2015-05-19 12:53:43	ahimsa	My ex's parents had one.
2015-05-19 12:53:49	pekuja	I like their Dr. Pepper clone "Dr. Pete"
2015-05-19 12:53:50	ahimsa	That's probably like 1/8th of a point.
2015-05-19 12:53:54	pekuja	I also like the Ginger Ale flavor
2015-05-19 12:54:04	Cryovat	The cheapest Sodastream machine is like 30 eur
2015-05-19 12:54:43	sir_garbagetruck	pekuja: well, I ... am looking at the bottle, and I see it's imported by someone in Helsinki, but I have no idea who makes this stuff (:

2015-05-19 12:58:40	sir_garbagetruck	yep, it may show up more in the coming months, I have no idea (:

2015-05-19 13:01:01	sir_garbagetruck	well I hadn't seen it before last month.  I'm not sure (:
2015-05-19 13:01:40	sir_garbagetruck	well they registered the domain in 2013 so I guess it's not all that new. I dunno. I don't do bottling and distribution (:
2015-05-19 13:03:42	pekuja	hmm, either the nutrition facts on the mysoda website are confusing, or they have about 5x the sugar that SodaStream flavors do... but I think it must just be confusing, which would mean they have about 1/5th of what SodaStream has

2015-05-19 13:09:44	Tijn	Hey rnlf - I'm going to send you that e-mail in a while, but I want to know: what is your email address actually? :P
2015-05-19 13:09:48	@sorceress	rxi, i decided that the best way was to mark where ramps can go, and it chooses whether to put them there or not. And if so, which.
2015-05-19 13:09:50	rnlf	ha! i just found out that my "real" tv in the living room understands NTSC \ø/
2015-05-19 13:09:54	boredDev	I'm confident it's doable. how messy and unreliable it will be is something I'm concerned about.
2015-05-19 13:10:21	rnlf	that means i can keep my accidentally bought ntsc atari cartridges

2015-05-19 13:13:02	rnlf	some guy took the money and did not ship the game i bought
2015-05-19 13:13:22	rxi	classic ebay
2015-05-19 13:13:36	rnlf	and now there are more and more ratings coming in for that guy that say the same
2015-05-19 13:13:58	rnlf	and i paid by bank transfer, which means i'll have to go to the police and stuff to hopefully get my money back
2015-05-19 13:14:04	rnlf	and i won't get it back from ebay directly
2015-05-19 13:14:12	rxi	rnlf, oh was it a lot of money?

2015-05-19 13:22:17	Cryovat	I like Lordi

2015-05-19 13:23:02	pekuja	though I chose UK before deciding on this plan, so I'm kinda doing it wrong

2015-05-19 13:32:09	boredDev	god I hate setting up ad stuff. why did admob have to make it easy, so everyone else seems really confusing.
2015-05-19 13:32:57	pekuja	I wonder if you can actually beat this game
2015-05-19 13:33:07	pekuja	I mean, it is an advertisement
2015-05-19 13:33:13	pekuja	so maybe they didn't bother to make it beatable
2015-05-19 13:33:18	pekuja	or it's random
2015-05-19 13:33:31	Tegu	I dunno :/
2015-05-19 13:34:00	pekuja	btw, what does "Bucks Fizz +" mean?

2015-05-19 14:06:35	>	ThatOtherPerson_ has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-19 14:06:52	Tijn	I'd say do the latter, boredDev 
2015-05-19 14:07:14	boredDev	it's easier, and it means they will have to see the ads if they hope to submit to the leaderboard.
2015-05-19 14:07:28	Tijn	Yeah
2015-05-19 14:07:31	Tijn	No ad = no score
2015-05-19 14:07:33	Tijn	Makes sense
2015-05-19 14:08:16	 *	Cryovat slaps bitslap
2015-05-19 14:08:20	boredDev	haha. I just don't know how I feel about forcing them to have an internet connection. there are times and places when you just don't have a connection. like on the train and such.
2015-05-19 14:08:37	+bitslap	hey Cryovat 
2015-05-19 14:08:48	Tijn	Just make a nice message, saying the leaderboard can't be reached because there's no internet
2015-05-19 14:09:35	Cryovat	boredDev: I occasionally take a bus through an area with spotty recepetion
2015-05-19 14:09:40	boredDev	hmm =\ well gotta get ads working regardless.
2015-05-19 14:09:42	Tijn	Have you seen Mind Game, bitslap? I told a colleague I saw GITS and he recommended this anime film
2015-05-19 14:09:48	Cryovat	It has made me gain a hate for web fonts
2015-05-19 14:09:52	+bitslap	Tijn: i have seen everything
2015-05-19 14:09:56	+bitslap	ask me what i think instead
2015-05-19 14:10:00	boredDev	haha
2015-05-19 14:10:06	Tijn	Tell me what you think without me asking B-)
2015-05-19 14:10:22	+bitslap	i was going to yesterday but didnt want to interupt you
2015-05-19 14:10:22	 *	boredDev sense some odd tension...
2015-05-19 14:10:25	+bitslap	Mind Game is awesome
2015-05-19 14:10:45	Tijn	Yeah, I get the impression it's pretty cool as well
2015-05-19 14:10:49	Tijn	Maybe I'll watch that one next
2015-05-19 14:10:59	Tijn	But I also have to see Akira I suppose
2015-05-19 14:11:07	+bitslap	Mind Game and Paprika are pretty cool, add Tekkon Kinkreet to that.
2015-05-19 14:11:15	+bitslap	those 3 are pretty similiar
2015-05-19 14:11:19	+bitslap	there is one more i think
2015-05-19 14:11:34	+bitslap	Akira is a must.
2015-05-19 14:12:03	+bitslap	so you liked GITS ?
2015-05-19 14:12:08	Tijn	I liked it a lot
2015-05-19 14:12:31	drnick	why do people have such a bad innate sense of statistics
2015-05-19 14:12:35	+bitslap	the 2nd movie is a bit different
2015-05-19 14:12:46	+bitslap	Tijn: the 2 seasons of the tv show is amazing all together
2015-05-19 14:12:51	Tijn	I'm not sure if I want to see the second one
2015-05-19 14:12:56	+bitslap	its like GITS the movie, but all the time.
2015-05-19 14:13:07	+bitslap	for 52*30 minutes
2015-05-19 14:13:19	Tijn	Yeah, but the shortness of the movie was also something that appealed to me :P
2015-05-19 14:13:28	drnick	it is ridiculous to see how people can easily believe in new results about common things
2015-05-19 14:13:53	+bitslap	Tijn: the tv series has some fillers and some red threads, "arcs".

2015-05-19 14:14:49	+bitslap	I only add the good ones
2015-05-19 14:15:04	drnick	when it should be obvious that if the exposure is very common and the association was not known before, the effect is either non-existent or very very small
2015-05-19 14:15:33	+bitslap	i blame capitalism drnick

2015-05-19 14:19:02	+bitslap	Oh?
2015-05-19 14:19:34	Tijn	I thought it was just weird, without being really interesting
2015-05-19 14:19:35	DesertRock	Princess Mononoke is my favorite :3
2015-05-19 14:20:35	+bitslap	ok

2015-05-19 14:21:58	drnick	I don't like Disney animations very much, they have too many silly concepts
2015-05-19 14:22:03	drnick	like their obsession with monarchy
2015-05-19 14:22:09	+bitslap	yesh
2015-05-19 14:22:23	+bitslap	you sound like a french student movement
2015-05-19 14:22:25	drnick	the day they make "Mickey's French Revolution", now that would be great
2015-05-19 14:22:30	+bitslap	:D
2015-05-19 14:22:49	drnick	even more now that I mentioned the french revolution I guess 
2015-05-19 14:22:54	+bitslap	monarchy and class
2015-05-19 14:23:10	drnick	but, they did make a very critical one, that is Atlantis
2015-05-19 14:23:23	Tijn	Even though I dont particularly care about Disney, I do like to say "Everything the light touches will be yours one day" when I'm somewhere up high with someone :P
2015-05-19 14:23:47	+bitslap	Tijn: the other movies like spirited away are pretty good, not a waste of time.
2015-05-19 14:23:49	+bitslap	i mean
2015-05-19 14:23:59	+bitslap	you could have accidently watched urotsikudöji

2015-05-19 14:26:32	Tijn	Haha
2015-05-19 14:26:35	+bitslap	for some reason that shit was interesting to import in sweden in the 80/90's
2015-05-19 14:27:02	Tijn	I have definitely not watched this ever
2015-05-19 14:27:18	+bitslap	Yah

2015-05-19 14:28:21	+bitslap	ok
2015-05-19 14:28:25	+bitslap	it was one of the exports
2015-05-19 14:28:41	Tijn	I only saw what was on TV

2015-05-19 14:30:09	+bitslap	i dont know your age
2015-05-19 14:30:13	+bitslap	but you said VHS
2015-05-19 14:30:15	+bitslap	so i guess 83

2015-05-19 14:30:24	Tijn	I'm from 83 yeah

2015-05-19 14:30:33	Tijn	I havent seen Starzinger
2015-05-19 14:30:47	+bitslap	i wonder what anime NL broadcasted
2015-05-19 14:30:52	Tijn	None, really :P
2015-05-19 14:30:59	+bitslap	most anime in sweden in the 80's was all on vhs
2015-05-19 14:31:16	+bitslap	i think the french was the biggest on importing anime
2015-05-19 14:31:30	drnick	VHS survived all the way to the early 2000s
2015-05-19 14:31:43	+bitslap	i still rented in the early 2000's
2015-05-19 14:31:57	Cryovat	bitslap: Heard of an old anime called Ebichu?
2015-05-19 14:32:12	Tijn	Until relatively recent, VHS was the only way to record TV
2015-05-19 14:32:17	+bitslap	no Cryovat 
2015-05-19 14:32:20	+bitslap	well maybe
2015-05-19 14:32:41	Cryovat	There's a cutesy anime from the nineties called Hamtaro about a hamster on zany adventures

2015-05-19 14:32:43	Tijn	I dont know when the first harddisk records came available, but I think DVD-recorders were always a bit crappy
2015-05-19 14:32:47	Cryovat	Really family friendly stuff
2015-05-19 14:32:51	+bitslap	no Cryovat, that would have been stuck on my retina

2015-05-19 14:33:17	+bitslap	this
2015-05-19 14:33:18	Cryovat	Ebichu is a very cutesy anime about a hamster that looks very much like Hamtaro
2015-05-19 14:33:21	drnick	Oh, I know Hamtaro
2015-05-19 14:33:32	Cryovat	But the difference is that Ebichu is incredibly inappropriate
2015-05-19 14:33:41	drnick	it aired in brazilian free air television
2015-05-19 14:33:43	Cryovat	Crude sex jokes and the like
2015-05-19 14:33:53	Tijn	Starzinger looks cool, but I've never seen it in my life
2015-05-19 14:33:55	drnick	it was shit
2015-05-19 14:33:58	Cryovat	I read a horrified review by a mother who had bought her kids the wrong show by accident

2015-05-19 14:35:58	+bitslap	its weird of socialist sweden to try and introduce japanese power fantasy to us
2015-05-19 14:36:09	+bitslap	lol
2015-05-19 14:37:50	Cryovat	If a decade of watching anime has taught me one thing, it is that there more family friendly an anime looks
2015-05-19 14:37:55	Cryovat	The more distrustful you should be
2015-05-19 14:38:17	+bitslap	Sailor Moon was ok
2015-05-19 14:38:40	+bitslap	and yeah, i can kinda understand why it was so late until sweden got anime
2015-05-19 14:38:48	Cryovat	Also, Sailor Moon was made into a surprisingly fun SNES RPG
2015-05-19 14:39:17	drnick	Samurai Pizza Cats, now THAT had a fun game adaptation

2015-05-19 14:45:11	drnick	bitslap, parallax was limited
2015-05-19 14:46:22	drnick	with default hardware (no special chips on the cartridge) changing scrolling midframe was difficult
2015-05-19 14:46:34	drnick	and changing scrolling mid-scanline undoable
2015-05-19 14:47:02	drnick	well, changing scrolling midframe once was relatively straightforward and widely done to implement status bars
2015-05-19 14:47:19	+bitslap	ah
2015-05-19 14:47:28	drnick	and mid scanline was actually doable but hard (cycle counting)
2015-05-19 14:47:58	FakeYou	http://www.flappyplane.net/
2015-05-19 14:48:01	drnick	you can see in that video most games are changing scrolling only once, bitslap

2015-05-19 14:54:19	Tijn	I know Vlambeer had issues with Sony getting Luftrausers accepted by the quality assurance guys because of the screen shake
2015-05-19 14:54:27	+bitslap	heh
2015-05-19 14:54:36	+bitslap	I think Vlambeer is overdoing the shake
2015-05-19 14:54:50	+bitslap	it is a cheap and useful effect
2015-05-19 14:54:58	+bitslap	perfect for an indie

2015-05-19 14:59:03	drnick	it is a nice trick to make bg from the same tiles as gf but darker and less saturated

2015-05-19 18:44:43	+bitslap	i need a computer in there
2015-05-19 18:45:56	TimBeaudetPC	I got the UV coordinates down (tested with colors), not the vert colors though- those still broke.  I've also tried adding the uniform sampled2D and call glUniform1i to set it to 0
2015-05-19 18:46:30	TimBeaudetPC	which is what I set glActiveTexture() to, although I don't understand activeTexture ...
2015-05-19 18:46:53	%NeiloGD	ok so glActiveTexture is used to tell GL "Texture binding and parameter calls will affect the texture in slot N
2015-05-19 18:47:01	%NeiloGD	imagine there is an array of textures in GL
2015-05-19 18:47:11	%NeiloGD	glActiveTexture selects which one you are going to work on.l
2015-05-19 18:47:27	TimBeaudetPC	So it will typically remain 1 unless I use multitexturing?

2015-05-19 18:48:08	>	Mmango has joined #ludumdare
2015-05-19 18:48:12	%NeiloGD	not really any 'multitexturing' concept since you do it all in shaders
2015-05-19 18:48:24	%NeiloGD	think of them as inputs to shaders
2015-05-19 18:48:41	TimBeaudetPC	But then, why would you ever need to activateTexture(1)?
2015-05-19 18:48:51	TimBeaudetPC	Does it replace glBindTexture?
2015-05-19 18:48:54	%NeiloGD	no
2015-05-19 18:49:11	%NeiloGD	imagine glBindTexture does this: textures[activeTexture] = texture
2015-05-19 18:49:21	TimBeaudetPC	ahh okay!
2015-05-19 18:49:24	%NeiloGD	glActiveTexture would go: activeTexture = i
2015-05-19 18:49:38	TimBeaudetPC	Thanks. that makes complete sense.
2015-05-19 18:49:58	%NeiloGD	using glUniformi to set the texture in the shader is that index there.
2015-05-19 18:50:02	%NeiloGD	so for now, just use 0 :)
2015-05-19 18:50:04	%NeiloGD	for 1 texture
2015-05-19 18:50:18	TimBeaudetPC	Indeed,  Both of those are setup.
2015-05-19 18:50:26	%NeiloGD	er, what ReactorScram said - GL_TEXTURE0 + 0.
2015-05-19 18:50:31	TimBeaudetPC		glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + 0);
2015-05-19 18:50:32	TimBeaudetPC		glUniform1i(glGetUniformLocation(tbiBasicShaderProgram, "textureSampler"), 0);
2015-05-19 18:50:33	%NeiloGD	that is for glActiveTexture only though
2015-05-19 18:50:36	%NeiloGD	yep that's correct.
2015-05-19 18:51:04	%NeiloGD	glActiveTexture(GL_TEXTURE0 + 0); glBindTexture( GL_TEXTURE_2D.....)

2015-05-19 18:59:46	%NeiloGD	just worth checking in case you were doing something acceptable by compatibility, not by core.
2015-05-19 18:59:56	TimBeaudetPC	oh good point

2015-05-19 19:06:25	%NeiloGD	3.3 = 3.2 + sampler state objects
2015-05-19 19:06:51	TimBeaudetPC	Oh crap...
2015-05-19 19:06:52	%NeiloGD	so for almost everything, use https://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man3/
2015-05-19 19:07:01	TimBeaudetPC	Because of this I'm going to need a special shader for my text vs sprites.

2015-05-19 19:08:37	%NeiloGD	TimBeaudetPC: you could use the same shader for both, but simpler for now to just use 2.

2015-05-19 19:11:13	%NeiloGD	TimBeaudetPC: Something cool you can do to use the same shader - use a colour matrix to reorder the colours
2015-05-19 19:11:33	%NeiloGD	in the shader

2015-05-19 19:20:37	%NeiloGD	you are going to end up with a lot of shaders :p
2015-05-19 19:20:58	%NeiloGD	but anyway, you could just use a matrix to transform the red to a
2015-05-19 19:21:13	TimBeaudetPC	NeiloGD: I will for bigger projects but for sprites/text and basics I'd like the same path if possible.
2015-05-19 19:21:24	%NeiloGD	yeah just make 1 big shader to do it all then :)
2015-05-19 19:21:25	TimBeaudetPC	NeiloGD: How would I do that and only for text?
2015-05-19 19:21:34	TimBeaudetPC	add another uniform?
2015-05-19 19:21:36	%NeiloGD	yep
2015-05-19 19:21:38	%NeiloGD	a matrix
2015-05-19 19:21:44	%NeiloGD	multiply the output colour by that matrix.
2015-05-19 19:21:50	%NeiloGD	identity for normal rgba -> rgba
2015-05-19 19:22:02	%NeiloGD	and change matrix to appropriately rearrange/combine elements.

2015-05-19 19:24:47	%NeiloGD	alpha test is just "if(alpha > alphafunc) discard;"

2015-05-19 19:31:34	%NeiloGD	I like the green but I think the layout is attrocious.
2015-05-19 19:31:47	%NeiloGD	it's very much a programmer UI
2015-05-19 19:32:16	ReactorScram	I don't think green on green is a good font color. Terminals are usally grey on black or green on black and that works fine
2015-05-19 19:32:32	%NeiloGD	the contrast looks good to me.
2015-05-19 19:32:38	%NeiloGD	but I guess it depends on vision, monitor, etc..

My Vertex2D stores the color in 32bit ARGB,  and then pass through:  glVertexAttribPointer(1, 4, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, GL_FALSE, sizeof(Vertex2D), (void*)8);  (I think I need to use AttribIPorinter though?  Anyway, in vert shader I have "in  vec4 vertexColor;"  how can I know the colors line up correctly?

2015-05-25 11:02:58	drnick	though, you do get a taste of most specialties during the clinical rotations in med school
2015-05-25 11:03:10	drnick	so you are not lost when it comes to choosing one
2015-05-25 11:03:31	Tijn	Do you have any idea on what you're going to choose? Like, a broad direction or something?
2015-05-25 11:03:35	drnick	usually you have a rough idea from the start, it is most refining the choice
2015-05-25 11:04:01	drnick	for example, in anatomy class you can already see that the most interested students are the ones who want to be surgeons
2015-05-25 11:04:47	drnick	whereas the ones who want to be physicians tend to be very interested in physiology

2015-05-25 11:05:33	drnick	myself I have been thinking of infectology
2015-05-25 11:05:58	drnick	or something in IM
2015-05-25 11:06:10	Tijn	So you're going to cure Ebola or something?
2015-05-25 11:06:19	drnick	haha
2015-05-25 11:06:22	Tijn	I'm not even sure doctors do that xD
2015-05-25 11:06:53	drnick	a case of Ebola would be a case for an infectologist yes
2015-05-25 11:07:40	Tijn	I think I would be too scared to be a doctor
2015-05-25 11:07:49	drnick	of what?
2015-05-25 11:07:52	Tijn	If I mess up, I could ruin someone's life
2015-05-25 11:08:05	drnick	ah
2015-05-25 11:08:14	Tijn	I dont want such responsibility :P
2015-05-25 11:08:17	drnick	I guess everyone has that fear

2015-05-25 11:09:02	Tijn	I rather avoid that :P
2015-05-25 11:10:09	Tijn	I'm trained as a sound engineer
2015-05-25 11:10:48	Tijn	You have to pick a speciality as well if you study for that, you can focus on doing live events or rather focus on recording
2015-05-25 11:11:19	Tijn	I was even too scared to do live stuff, I think the comfort of the studio is much nicer
2015-05-25 11:11:28	Tijn	If you mess up in the studio, you just do another take
2015-05-25 11:11:33	Tijn	If you mess up live, everybody's deaf :P

2015-05-25 11:12:47	Tijn	Well sure
2015-05-25 11:13:01	Tijn	But I rather pick a job where I'm carefully preparing something before it goes out the door
2015-05-25 11:13:15	Tijn	Instead of doing it in front of everyone in real-time

2015-05-25 11:22:15	drnick	isn't that the suicidal vocalist?

2015-05-25 11:22:49	Tijn	drnick you know who Kurt Cobain is
2015-05-25 11:23:12	Tijn	He's the voice of my generation, man
2015-05-25 11:24:02	drnick	why, was his music particularly impacting
2015-05-25 11:24:16	Tijn	Actually, I was too young to really knew what was going on when he was popular :P
2015-05-25 11:24:18	Tijn	But yeah
2015-05-25 11:24:35	Tijn	Nirvana had a huge impact on youth culture

2015-05-25 11:26:01	Tijn	He performed in torn jeans and a shirt
2015-05-25 11:26:14	Tijn	Compare that with the rock music of the 80s :P

2015-05-25 11:27:39	drnick	well I was never too into the musical phenomena
2015-05-25 11:27:47	+bitslap	uh
2015-05-25 11:28:00	+bitslap	just had the most intense pvp in DS II
2015-05-25 11:28:10	+bitslap	i was invaded but prevailed
2015-05-25 11:28:18	drnick	BITSLAP SHALL PREVAIL
2015-05-25 11:28:29	+bitslap	ran into a tight alley and switch to my spear and he was mine
2015-05-25 11:28:31	+bitslap	!
2015-05-25 11:28:49	drnick	lol, good tactics
2015-05-25 11:29:01	drnick	I played a few seconds of that game and hated it
2015-05-25 11:29:04	+bitslap	^_^
2015-05-25 11:29:08	Tijn	Which game is that?
2015-05-25 11:29:12	+bitslap	dark souls II
2015-05-25 11:29:18	+bitslap	subtitled as best game ver
2015-05-25 11:29:22	+bitslap	ever
2015-05-25 11:29:24	drnick	it was too dark and you couldn't see things well
2015-05-25 11:29:26	+bitslap	taglined even
2015-05-25 11:29:29	drnick	I fell into an abysm a few times
2015-05-25 11:29:34	+bitslap	ouch
2015-05-25 11:29:39	tacospice	i'd say it's 50/50 between ds1 and 2
2015-05-25 11:29:45	tacospice	depends on what elements you're into
2015-05-25 11:29:45	drnick	also the controls were annoying
2015-05-25 11:29:56	tacospice	still
2015-05-25 11:30:03	tacospice	the soulsborne series is one the best ever 
2015-05-25 11:30:16	+bitslap	yup
2015-05-25 11:30:25	drnick	also it is probably too hard but I don't know because I barely saw any enemies
2015-05-25 11:30:31	+bitslap	tacospice: im almost at the end of ds2:remake
2015-05-25 11:30:33	tacospice	after 2 months of bloodborne, the controls in the witcher 3 are a pain sometimes
2015-05-25 11:30:46	tacospice	not as direct and tight
2015-05-25 11:30:51	<	Jacob123 ha salido (Ping timeout)
2015-05-25 11:30:52	tacospice	only played for 2 days though
2015-05-25 11:30:52	drnick	also everyone knows the best game ever is Conker's BFD
2015-05-25 11:31:23	Tijn	A game can't be the best game if it's not turn-based :P
2015-05-25 11:32:10	drnick	only good turn based I ever played was Fallout 1
2015-05-25 11:32:40	Sinuath	The best game ever was Classic Asteroids, it's all been down hill ever since.
2015-05-25 11:32:55	Tijn	Never played HoMM, drnick? Civ? MoO? Pokemon? :P
2015-05-25 11:33:21	drnick	I have played Civ
2015-05-25 11:33:59	drnick	I haven't played Heroes of Mega Mighty, Medal of Onor and Poketu Monsutero
2015-05-25 11:34:35	FARTRON	distant worlds is the best 4x currently
2015-05-25 11:34:41	drnick	I also played nethack, it was cool but unfathomable
2015-05-25 11:34:50	FARTRON	i've been pretty addicted to crusader kings lately but it's not really 4x
