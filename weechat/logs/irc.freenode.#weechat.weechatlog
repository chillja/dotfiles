2015-01-28 11:58:30	@FlashCode	you have "current_size" in bar_window
2015-01-28 11:58:40	GermainZ	FlashCode: hdata?
2015-01-28 11:58:58	GermainZ	yup
2015-01-28 11:59:35	@FlashCode	GermainZ: but this can be changed at any refresh by weechat
2015-01-28 11:59:49	@FlashCode	so not sure it's a good idea to rely on that
2015-01-28 11:59:49	GermainZ	FlashCode: yes, of course
2015-01-28 12:00:18	GermainZ	I must -- it needs to be updated if the window's height changes
2015-01-28 12:00:22	Zarthus	that was amazingly easy. cheers GermainZ.

2015-04-05 18:40:03	Starthunder	So…currently, you have to implement things like the meta-j jump keybindings by going `meta-j01 = "/buffer 1"`, `meta-j02 = "/buffer 2"`, ...
2015-04-05 18:41:04	Starthunder	Any chance that could somehow be generalized such that those hundred (minus one) lines could be reduced to one?
2015-04-05 18:41:45	Alissa	Starthunder: go.py
2015-04-05 18:41:54	Alissa	bind that to meta-g as it says on the /help
2015-04-05 18:42:06	Alissa	then you can use meta-g, type in the buffer number, press enter, and voila~
2015-04-05 18:42:58	Starthunder	I'd really rather not have to press enter, though.
2015-04-05 18:43:23	Alissa	That's how you'd have to determine the buffer number without installing 1000 keybindings.
2015-04-05 18:45:32	Starthunder	Yeah…I'm asking if something could be implemented that would make it possible to reduce even the default meta-j bindings to one line in the configfile.

2015-04-08 09:28:08	OnkelTem	gb: this is exactly why Bitlbee does: it adds underscore to the beginning
2015-04-08 09:28:23	Nothing4You	and if you have a nick collision e.g. due to a rejoin after a netsplit, one of the connection gets a nickchange to the id, so you have a nick starting with a digit
2015-04-08 09:28:36	OnkelTem	but there is good workaround: Bitlbee allows to rename! Love it

2015-04-08 09:32:59	damyan^	Hi there. I just found a strange weechat behavior: when a filter is used, say irc_privmsg + regex youtube.com, I still get highlighted when some sends: "hey, damyan^, look: www.youtube.com/bla-bla-bla". the message gets properly filtered out, but I got the highlight in the weechat.bar.status.items, which is a kind of weird. is that by design, or a bug?
2015-04-08 09:33:02	Nothing4You	oh, nevermind
2015-04-08 09:33:07	Mike1_	Nothing4You: „words may begin or end with "*" for partial match; example: "test,(?-i)*toto*,flash*“
2015-04-08 09:33:10	Nothing4You	i just did /help on that option and noticed it's not regex
2015-04-08 09:33:12	Nothing4You	yes
2015-04-08 09:33:49	Mike1_	I don’t want to purge my whole weechat config just because of highlights :(
2015-04-08 09:34:00	Xe	I use the script highlight.lua
2015-04-08 09:34:10	Nothing4You	weechat highlights work fine for me

2015-04-08 09:34:33	gb	what did you do to break highlights?
2015-04-08 09:34:54	Nothing4You	Mike1_: your nick should get yourself highlights even without using extra highlight configs i believe

2015-04-08 09:36:19	Mike1_	even though my config is now back to default as far as I can tell
2015-04-08 09:38:08	gb	how about in highmon?
2015-04-08 09:38:21	@nils_2	damyan^: i guess you mean the hotlist bar item? the hotlist tells you that an highlight message is in that buffer. don't know if its a bug or not.
2015-04-08 09:38:57	Mike1_	highmon?
2015-04-08 09:39:02	gb	try /set irc.look.highlight_channel "$nick"

2015-04-27 13:16:00	@FlashCode	though the limitation is that you can not set less than one second (it could be improved in the future)
2015-04-27 13:16:07	Yaniel	make it trigger the paste warning earlier? :P

2015-04-27 13:16:31	@FlashCode	then you could write a script that checks your outgoing messages rate

2015-04-27 14:55:50	nami	bility
2015-04-27 14:55:52	@FlashCode	so you can upgrade for example from 1.0 to 1.2 without installing ever 1.1
2015-04-27 14:56:19	nami	does it use some kind of api? or something else that never change to save data?
2015-04-27 14:56:20	@FlashCode	this is designed to be compatible with old releases, that's why this command is nice :)
2015-04-27 14:56:45	nami	uhm can can you downgrade?
2015-04-27 14:56:46	@FlashCode	yes, the format is the same (since 0.3.0, which was a major rewrite)

2015-04-27 17:26:33	gb	so read log from alt <home> and set bookmarks for jumping back to later with /book # maybe
2015-04-27 17:27:39	gb	not my idea but several others sugested similar
2015-04-27 17:28:16	strayPuppy	I think that's a great idea gb, I think we did discuss that a while back.
2015-04-27 17:29:21	gb	basically i just use grep to reread stuff of importance now with -c -a or similar flag
2015-04-27 17:29:49	gb	dwpends on my poor memory
2015-04-27 17:30:03	gb	that and ctrl r uparrow
2015-04-27 17:30:34	strayPuppy	yeah, me too, but bookmarks would make finding saved things like code snippets, easier to find later.
2015-04-27 17:31:40	strayPuppy	named or tagged bookmarks would be awesome!
2015-04-27 17:31:57	gb	harder to grep ctrl r stuff you aint read yet though :)

2015-04-27 17:33:45	gb	perhaps a meta log file storing tags/bookmarks/colours would be useful for recreating an exact portion of a buffer though, lot of coding i suspect
2015-04-27 17:34:36	gb	maybe it's on the roadmap in flash's mind already :)
2015-04-27 17:35:11	strayPuppy	just look in your cb plugin :)

2015-04-27 17:35:56	strayPuppy	huh? I been using that forever.
2015-04-27 17:36:27	strayPuppy	quite handy
2015-04-27 17:36:42	gb	well my config was upgraded from .4 where it did not exist :P

2015-04-27 17:38:08	strayPuppy	I think I added mine manually though

2015-04-27 18:03:08	zamzing	My core is at 2 currently. So in your case, jumping to core resets the readline for all other buffers?
2015-04-27 18:03:51	gb	seems too i don't pretend to know how/why it works :)
2015-04-27 18:04:56	gb	but if i idle in a buffer for a long time readline scrolls off the top regardless if i'm idling in core or sumwhere else

2015-04-27 18:10:13	gb	i also use it for my own #log channel
2015-04-27 18:10:33	zamzing	I'd like to integrate my IMs... is worth the install?
2015-04-27 18:10:45	gb	but faecesbook etc i do not bother with
2015-04-27 18:10:57	gb	depends on why you need it

2015-04-27 18:15:20	gb	weechat's format_lines basically put the final nail into irssi for me
2015-04-27 18:16:01	gb	but other scripts like colorise_nicks are ream atop of a great client
2015-04-27 18:16:13	gb	cream
2015-04-27 18:17:04	gb	pretty much just apt-get install bitlbee and /server add lh localhost in weechat
2015-04-27 18:17:19	gb	follow destructions in bitlbee and your set
2015-04-27 18:17:30	zamzing	I use colorise_nicks, but haven't heard of format_lines. What does it do?
2015-04-27 18:17:46	zamzing	I'll try bitlbee today.

2015-04-27 22:37:59	gb	depends on the compentency of the user
2015-04-27 22:38:04	RayzrShrp	under debian i had the sources updating every day but with centos there doesnt seem to be as nice of a way to stay current

2015-04-27 22:41:07	Alissa	Second, you should just be able to hover over and scroll.

2015-04-27 22:41:26	Alissa	screen should do it by default, ssh should pass it through. It depends on the terminal, sparr.
2015-04-27 22:41:45	RayzrShrp	tmux is nicer then screen in my opinion

2015-04-27 22:42:29	gb	alt m toggles mouse on/off and in some cases you may need to toggle mouse off then on before it will work, especially on laggy or mosh connections
2015-04-27 22:42:32	Alissa	Hm. Try holding alt, then scroll?
2015-04-27 22:43:29	gb	if it's not in status.items already you can add mouse_status to let you know if mouse is enabled

2015-04-28 00:43:33	@FlashCode	with /set all values are verified by weechat and immediately applied
2015-04-28 00:43:48	@FlashCode	(same with /iset which is calling /set)

2015-04-28 00:55:36	Lamperi-	Git contains all versions of weechat, you can choose a stable version with "git checkout <tag-name>" where tag name is say v1.1.1

2015-04-28 00:56:40	gb	hmm k i spose you can change the tag to upgrade to a later stable when it's released easilly enough too
2015-04-28 00:57:27	gb	i'm happy using dev though

2015-04-28 04:01:43	gb	just insert a ; between it ans /exec whatever
2015-04-28 04:02:50	gb	i basically have an alias called beep which i can just /beep to test if alsa or pulseaudio has broken/been muted by systemd

2015-04-28 04:12:12	gb	you need mixer settings set to be hearable :)
2015-04-28 04:12:36	gb	an audio file which is not annoying and something like aplay or paplay to play it

2015-04-28 04:50:29	Nicd-	but I've never needed to upload files to a paste. I'd use other services for sharing files
2015-04-28 04:50:45	winny	pomf.se if it's public data, otherwise dropbox
2015-04-28 04:51:02	Yaniel	very handy for showing command line output on irc
2015-04-28 04:51:19	GermainZ	Yaniel: ptpb.pw handles that much better IMO. You can use it just like ix.io/sprunge.us but also like pomf.se or Gists

2015-04-28 04:52:17	Yaniel	pomf.se wins on naming though
2015-04-28 04:52:19	winny	so is ix.io just a sprunge.us with some more features like paste deletion
2015-04-28 04:52:39	winny	and a (bash) shell function
2015-04-28 04:52:47	semeion	i use a script in geany for that, i select the text, hit ctrl-1 and it send to ix.io host and put the link in my clipboard :P

2015-04-28 05:01:26	GermainZ	I just have an alias for ptpb I use for everything -- stdin, files, piping, etc. :p

2015-04-28 05:01:37	GermainZ	also, ptpb has link shortening which comes in handy sometimes

2015-04-28 11:51:46	DIEHLC	hello everyone, is there a way to get Weechat and Tmux to work together right? I need to refresh the screen constantly.. tmux makes it so the whole page doesnt scroll, and when switching buffers it leaves text from the last buffer.
2015-04-28 11:52:06	Yaniel	hmm?
2015-04-28 11:52:13	Yaniel	page up/page down scrolls weechat just fine
2015-04-28 11:52:30	Kunsi	DIEHLC: weechat and tmux work fine here
2015-04-28 11:52:36	Yaniel	what terminal are you using?
2015-04-28 11:52:45	DIEHLC	not for me for whatever reason. Idk why. hmmm weird... im using Gnome-terminal
2015-04-28 11:53:30	Yaniel	I sometimes get old chars not cleared when using mosh in fingerterm to connect to the machine with weechat/tmux
2015-04-28 11:53:38	DIEHLC	it works for the most part but when i join a channel, I still have the MTOD on the screen from the last. But after I refress it works until the screen fills. its strange
2015-04-28 11:53:49	DIEHLC	*refresh
2015-04-28 11:54:21	DIEHLC	well anyway to make the window refresh command run every so often or something?
2015-04-28 11:55:39	Yaniel	check your $TERM
2015-04-28 11:56:29	DIEHLC	its xterm-256color. Strangely. though it is set in tmux.conf
2015-04-28 11:56:49	DIEHLC	set to screen-256color i mean
2015-04-28 11:57:12	Yaniel	tmux always sets it to screen or screen-256color based on what it was when tmux was started
2015-04-28 11:57:20	Yaniel	you shouldn't touch it in tmux.conf
2015-04-28 11:58:30	DIEHLC	well since it is showing xterm-256color in tmux, could that be the cause you think?

2015-04-28 17:00:45	dc_	shouldnt, but just curious

2015-04-28 17:01:05	dc_	20 years of ircii and irssi.. so i'm used to simpler times
2015-04-28 17:01:13	dc_	switching to weechat has been like irc'ing for the first time
2015-04-28 17:01:16	winny	yeah, i'm a tmux fanboy mainly because of its sane defaults (you can tell if you're in a tmux session from the always present bottom bar)
2015-04-28 17:01:37	winny	and therefore easier to use horrid things like nested tmux sessions
2015-04-28 17:01:52	dc_	i really just need nick completion when starting with an @
2015-04-28 17:01:55	dc_	and i'm in heaven

2015-04-28 17:06:52	winny	i was invited to a slack not too long ago, seemed nice, but requires extra effort (the organization already has an irc channel)
2015-04-28 17:07:04	dc_	slack is a LOT more than chat
2015-04-28 17:07:10	dc_	once you start using the integrations

2015-04-28 17:07:15	dc_	you can see the power
2015-04-28 17:07:46	dc_	and with tools like ifttt and zapier, almost anything can push to/pull from slack
2015-04-28 17:08:13	winny	i'm kind of at that stage where slack is like plan 9, and irc is unix, and i'm simply not excited enough to use it
2015-04-28 17:08:33	winny	but i can see myself using it instead of creating a new irc channel
2015-04-28 17:08:37	dc_	i'm excited about slack for three reasons
2015-04-28 17:08:50	dc_	1: it allows non-tech people to contribute to the discussions

2015-05-14 09:56:40	phibs	ah ok
2015-05-14 09:56:42	phibs	any idea what it is

2015-05-14 09:57:14	StolenToast	cool, thanks
2015-05-14 09:57:15	LadyAlissa	Not myself, but there was talk of it once I believe
2015-05-14 09:57:25	StolenToast	I really like andchat but I'll give the weechat app a try
2015-05-14 09:57:37	StolenToast	if I prefer andchat I'll just set up znc again and point weechat to it
2015-05-14 09:57:57	sparr	how can I scroll to the bottom of a buffer quickly, on a mac keyboard over ssh?

2015-05-14 10:00:08	StolenToast	I found it better than the other 4 I tried
2015-05-14 10:00:15	StolenToast	I'll check out tapchat though
2015-05-14 10:00:34	phibs	it's not free unfortunately and you have to run a server
2015-05-14 10:00:38	phibs	but it works very well
2015-05-14 10:01:21	Rory	nnthe weechat android client that connects to the relay is good enough for getting notifications while out and stuff
2015-05-14 10:01:33	Rory	It would do as a full fat client in a pinch, but lacks features
2015-05-14 10:01:56	phibs	Know what's better? Slack :) (But obv that's not "IRC")
2015-05-14 10:03:06	StolenToast	well server is not a problem, but pay might be...
2015-05-14 10:03:06	StolenToast	depends on how much it wows me

2015-05-19 12:28:41	linduxed	for some reason my weechat "cuts off" background color in some lines
2015-05-19 12:28:56	linduxed	so for instance the separating lines which have the topic message
2015-05-19 12:29:06	linduxed	they've got a blue background color
2015-05-19 12:29:18	linduxed	but now it's black right after the last character

2015-05-19 12:34:51	linduxed	:-D
2015-05-19 12:35:54	@FlashCode	I can understand, but it's less fun for people like me to answer the same question every day ;)
2015-05-19 12:36:10	@FlashCode	that's why they invented the "FAQ" :)
2015-05-19 12:36:11	linduxed	FlashCode: i completely understand and respect that!
2015-05-19 12:36:13	gb	just hurry up and find a real bug :)
2015-05-19 12:36:27	linduxed	i just explain why it is that people don't read FAQs
2015-05-19 12:36:29	linduxed	:-)
2015-05-19 12:39:33	gb	wonder if we could make a plain speak search of the logs that'd sort of just grep for the question/faq's/what have you and respond in the buffer of the person asking?

2015-05-19 12:43:49	gb	a default trigger maybe of if input bar in #weechat search for $input->/print $answer
2015-05-19 12:45:17	gb	if $answer not founf then output makes it through to freenode/#weechat

2015-05-19 12:51:09	gb	of course most of the answers would probably be read the faq :)
2015-05-19 12:51:38	t3chguy	Well just have it connect to a Google Custom Search pointed at the FAQ
2015-05-19 12:51:47	t3chguy	and show the top few results

2015-05-19 12:53:37	gb	am thinking more of an internal database that is a plugin of weechat's not needing an external network connection to function, especially if the issue is a network related issue
2015-05-19 12:53:45	Junka	i was just disconnected from the server, on core server i had this msg "irc: reading data on socket: error -54 Error in the pull function."

2015-05-19 13:00:42	gb	by latest stable you do mean 1.2 and not the mislabelled 1.1.1?
2015-05-19 13:02:00	gb	not that it'd help because i think this issue was a long time ago and would probably have been fixed if it were a bug

2015-05-25 09:51:24	t3chguy	I'm sure
2015-05-25 09:51:28	t3chguy	I was moving weeChat
2015-05-25 09:51:39	demize	And?
2015-05-25 09:51:45	demize	/upgrade -quit
2015-05-25 09:51:52	t3chguy	FlashCode: how much can I recover from a backup which was taken whilst WeeChat was running?
2015-05-25 09:52:12	t3chguy	did I actually get the command wrong
2015-05-25 09:52:14	Yaniel	t3chguy: there is no /quit -upgrade

2015-05-25 09:52:21	t3chguy	Well then
2015-05-25 09:52:28	t3chguy	time to pull a backup from the backup server
2015-05-25 09:52:31	t3chguy	and see how much I can recover
2015-05-25 09:55:01	t3chguy	my uptime is gone xD
2015-05-25 09:55:03	t3chguy	damn wrong command
2015-05-25 09:55:04	t3chguy	fs
2015-05-25 09:55:15	t3chguy	but surely all of my configs shouldn't have gone with a regular /quit?
2015-05-25 09:57:26	Yaniel	they should be saved on quit
2015-05-25 09:58:01	t3chguy	I literally quit, then cp -R the .weechat from ~/.weechat to /home/WeeChat/.weechat
2015-05-25 09:58:06	t3chguy	then chown it to WeeChat:WeeChat
2015-05-25 09:58:09	t3chguy	and *broken*
2015-05-25 09:59:47	t3chguy	do I even include /root/ in my backups xD

2015-05-25 10:03:36	t3chguy	any way without stopping it through upstart?
2015-05-25 10:06:17	demize	No clue. I thankfully don't have to use upstart much.
2015-05-25 10:06:30	demize	Ask your distributions support channel.

2015-05-25 11:05:02	KindOne	t3chguy, always fun to accidentally close out of a channel window, I run a different irc client, but in my client I just run a command that echo's something into the log files of every opened channel/query window and look for the file that was not modifed at the time that command was run
2015-05-25 11:05:05	drewo	Hi :) I'm pretty new to weechat, and irc in general. How do I switch between channels I've joined?

2015-05-25 11:15:59	t3chguy	quit -upgrade should do the same as upgrade -quit xD
2015-05-25 11:16:18	gb	one way to prevent a restart would be to mv location of your running bin/weechat out of the way till you were done configuring
2015-05-25 11:16:28	t3chguy	eh too late now gb
2015-05-25 11:16:30	t3chguy	leaving it on root
2015-05-25 11:16:32	t3chguy	too much hassle xD
2015-05-25 11:16:44	gb	hehe
2015-05-25 11:16:47	t3chguy	lost uptime and some minor configuration options and some open buffers
2015-05-25 11:18:10	gb	yey of lil patience :P

2015-05-25 11:25:27	gb	i think flash would be the better person to ask, it's his baby after all
2015-05-25 11:25:33	t3chguy	its like pisg but pretty
2015-05-25 11:25:37	t3chguy	well it runs off log files anyway
2015-05-25 11:25:46	t3chguy	and its nearly-compat with weechat logs
2015-05-25 11:25:54	t3chguy	so could just post-process my current log file
2015-05-25 11:26:21	gb	might break with log rotate too though?
2015-05-25 11:26:39	t3chguy	if log rotate kept the last 30 days uncompressed, it'd be fine
2015-05-25 11:26:50	t3chguy	like every night move the file into a datestamped one
2015-05-25 11:26:58	t3chguy	and every day move the oldest into an archive
2015-05-25 11:27:29	gb	you need to get a life i think :)
2015-05-25 11:27:41	t3chguy	thats why I automate things xD
