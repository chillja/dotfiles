2015-01-22 11:35:27	TacticalJoke	It's that way because the text might be more elaborate than a string (e.g., it could be a Spanned).

2015-01-22 12:53:01	herriojr	the status bar?
2015-01-22 12:53:08	Agamemnus	yeah, i guess
2015-01-22 12:53:16	herriojr	ok, that has to do with 2 things
2015-01-22 12:53:53	herriojr	no I guess, is this a bar that names your activity or the bar at the top with the battery icon, etc.?
2015-01-22 12:54:04	Agamemnus	I'm using Crosswalk.. built-in Chrome. Version 9 doesn't have the problem. Version 10 has a worse problem -- sometimes it won't disappear and gets stickied
2015-01-22 12:54:10	Agamemnus	yes it's with the battery icon
2015-01-22 12:54:21	s73v3r	Why does Android not have the concept of a Service Mark:?
2015-01-22 12:54:38	Agamemnus	Apparently, the sticky part was a Chromium bug. Version 10 uses a different version of Chromium
2015-01-22 12:54:47	Agamemnus	than version 12
2015-01-22 12:54:56	herriojr	Agamemnus: if it disappears then reappears, it most likely has to do with one activity declaring itself as not wanting to show the status bar and the next one saying it does (or not specifying)
2015-01-22 12:54:57	Agamemnus	Version 9 is different, too.
2015-01-22 12:55:04	Agamemnus	AHA

2015-02-21 17:34:59	drinfernoo	erm... usually, sort of? in most cases, a Fragment is started via a FragmentTransaction (more about that in the android docs, I linked them), but in your case MaterialNavigationDrawer will be doing most of the work for you. you simply create a Section, pass it your fragment, and it inflates and attaches it.

2015-04-05 18:00:14	TacticalJoke	Hmm, I don't think that'd work.  I think you'd have to set padding on the root element or padding/margin on a child element.

2015-04-05 20:41:03	creitve	Yes. I had them run simultaneously, with splash overlaying, but it was causing weird race-condition fatal that nobody around me could debug properly
2015-04-05 20:41:57	drose379	Ok, so what I have instead of a splash screen is just the logo of my application (not really a logo, just text, but could be a logo) and a little loading animation show while the app is pulling the data, then dissapear and the list is populated as soon as the data is ready
2015-04-05 20:42:28	drose379	So sometimes it takes less then a second, sometimes a few seconds, but the point is that you get to show your logo and branding, but it is not getting in the users way

2015-04-07 22:40:27	duncannz	that sounds like a horrible thing for mobile devices

2015-04-07 22:40:52	duncannz	also skype takes the longest of all my apps to open so yeah.. it's just an all round buggy app

2015-04-08 02:01:11	t2mkn	earlier it was better, just type MAIN and select. this should be revorced. its time consuming.
2015-04-08 02:01:46	whatitis	it's not something that is touched alot after setup, but just remember to double check

2015-04-08 02:12:30	whatitis	google that, there is probably a fix, but i'm still thinking you need to run the Media Scanner or whatever it's called to update media
2015-04-08 02:13:19	Zta	So the computer doesn't actually access /storage/emulated/legacy/Movies?  But files are moved to another location?

2015-04-08 02:19:03	Marlinski	iprime: so drawer appear below the Tabs
2015-04-08 02:19:17	Marlinski	I would like it to "push" the main window to the right

2015-04-08 10:09:25	Syzygy	technically you can use almost any kind of view as a button. set a drawable (image or xml) as background and set an on click listener on the view.
2015-04-08 10:09:26	Muchoz	It's quite a hassle probably to get it to use your own font. I have never tried it, but I wouldn't do it and just use images that you create yourself.
2015-04-08 10:10:03	Syzygy	We actually use a font for most of our icons and it's working fairly well..
2015-04-08 10:10:23	Muchoz	The Android SDK has quite a bit of icons in the SDK I thought or there was a pack you can download in the design guidelines.

2015-04-08 10:16:02	Muchoz	MooGoo, well what I had in mind is let's say we use an ArrayList as the source of the data. Based on the value of the index it would generate a HeaderView or ItemView.
2015-04-08 10:16:20	Muchoz	Then there would be simple methods to determine whether it's a header or item view of course.

I want to implement loading spinner directly into my ImageLoader asynctask class, so it could replace image with spinner onPreExecute and put the image there onPostExecute. However, the only solution SO brought me is to add a progressbar to layout and switch their visibility. I don't want to alter layout, is there a better way to do it only from the loader?

2015-04-08 19:04:34	herriojr	bitkiller: so if you need to save state on progress, you need to post it back to the UI thread

2015-04-27 09:26:55	danijoo	myke, your problem with it is they dont allow you to release features they have in premium (which actually finance their free tools)
2015-04-27 09:26:59	myke	makes me a bit skittish about kotlin as well, since selling more intellij's is an explicit goal
2015-04-27 09:27:05	danijoo	theys very selfish
2015-04-27 09:27:20	yiati	myke: Did you post this a while ago, I see no paste, and yes you can create plugins
2015-04-27 09:27:30	MooGoo	so is there any way to import a module into an AS project from a common code base, instead of copying that code into the project?

2015-04-27 11:03:14	soLucien	hello guys ! I am writing a report ( for school) and i need to write about the connectivity capabilities of mobile devices ( the GSM/CDMA, wifi,bluetoothh chips, what are the capabilities and limitations of the hardware, etc). So far, my research shows that the only architecture worth taking into consideration is ARM, with over 90% of the market. Is this true? if so, do you know where i could find some research about the connectivity capacities of ARM?
2015-04-27 11:03:14	soLucien	I am looking specifically into wi-fi offloading, and if it possible to do software emulation for this. to be more speciffic, i would like to know whether it is possible to get some identification information from the GSM chip(SIM card) that could be used for connecting to a managed wi-fi
2015-04-27 11:03:25	claint	dimitrovskif: Yes I did. You just pass a horizontal layout to it.

2015-04-27 11:04:58	soLucien	 (in theory) could some software running as a service on your mobile phone do the following steps: 1) start  listening when it is on a specific(designated) wifi network 2) when a phone call is received AND you are on the WiFi , switch to VOIP

2015-04-27 11:41:47	Datasmurfen	(We use the same code).  Does anyone have any clue on how to fix this? Yes I have used Google, and StackOverFlow. (They are only mention my issue).
2015-04-27 11:41:56	adv_	anyone knows how to add a keyword to the google play store search?
2015-04-27 11:42:01	trevor-e	that's what I was thinking, looks slightly different than normal Java string format args
2015-04-27 11:42:07	adv_	i want the app to be listed when searching that keyword
2015-04-27 11:42:13	adv_	but it's not in the name of the app, it's in the description

2015-04-27 11:50:38	adq	adv_, the store search engine is incredibly weird, not sure it's possible. I know sony used to do an horrible hack with "LiveWare™ extension for SmartWatch", they asked developers to put that in their description
2015-04-27 11:50:47	adq	so their (sony) app could find your app
2015-04-27 11:52:17	adq	a single keyword might not work, you could imagine using dfgFG5345DFLSfklsdf (manually generated) to search for, but few times I did search on an explicit title (not even related to the description), the result of the query was far from being relevant, not even giving the app with the exact title i searched

2015-04-27 16:03:21	anahumar	are these two service related to sdk? http://snag.gy/DpUrd.jpg

2015-04-27 16:05:08	myke	most of my adb problems are solved by killing adb then running as root
2015-04-27 16:05:12	donguston	myke, are there any differences between SMS messages sent/recieved from apps without any user input and ones sent from messaging apps?
2015-04-27 16:05:15	myke	esp when multiple devices are involved
2015-04-27 16:05:20	anahumar	then I try to compile and get those errors

2015-04-27 16:05:40	donguston	ok
2015-04-27 16:05:47	mEck0	anahumar: Sometimes the IDE don’t refresh the adb state so you can also try to restart it now when server is running.
2015-04-27 16:05:55	myke	i use 3 apps that can send/receive sms typed by humans and they all operate on the same set of messages
2015-04-27 16:06:06	anahumar	do you what are these?  http://snag.gy/DpUrd.jpg
2015-04-27 16:06:23	myke	adb is client server, so once you have the server part running, any client should work properly
2015-04-27 16:06:33	mEck0	anahumar: I assume you’re running Eclipse / ADT? Since I’m using Android Studio I barely get any adb issues anymore.
2015-04-27 16:06:34	myke	so you can run adb from the command line as root and AS, etc should work with it
2015-04-27 16:07:18	anahumar	that is right mEck0 .. I was suggest studio here and since then I got eclipse screwed

2015-04-27 16:08:49	myke	yes that too

2015-04-27 16:56:05	g00s	no
2015-04-27 16:56:14	danijoo	no but once you start a build, it starts it. and it will get reused from that point on
2015-04-27 16:56:21	danijoo	unless you let it time out (3 hours)
2015-04-27 16:56:22	TacticalJoke	How does the IDE run, then?  I guess I assumed java.exe had to be running for Java apps.
2015-04-27 16:56:51	danijoo	well thats the Android Studio Windows Launcher process
2015-04-27 16:57:16	g00s	it grows by about 50mb each time you build
2015-04-27 16:57:42	danijoo	it also sometimes block my directory.

2015-04-27 19:15:40	TacticalJoke	In some cases, the desire to test non-public methods is a code smell, so do consider that.

2015-04-27 19:16:13	eghdk	code smell?
2015-04-27 19:16:25	TacticalJoke	The general idea is that testing public behaviour should entail testing everything; that if testing all public methods doesn't test all private methods then the class isn't coherent.
2015-04-27 19:16:39	TacticalJoke	But I can think of a few exceptions.

Another feature would be to set a widget with the list of things. If these two things were added, this app would be practically perfect.

2015-04-28 00:11:25	creitve	My activity listens to locations changes and posts them to an app singleton, where I can access the coordinates. However, I'd also like to be able to refresh said coordinates even AFTER the fragment was displayed. How can I listen to the changes, if the listener is not in parent activity?
2015-04-28 00:11:39	whatitis	desmin88, you are spending a lot of time with this, maybe take a day or 2 off from it. From seeing what you've been posting i have 0 clue what you are doing with your descriptions from passed few days except, you are trying to use MoPub with Admob

2015-04-28 00:25:09	Ashiren	if you want to be sure to run something after it being drawn (i.e. size measure) after all you can use view.post(new Runnable()) which will run as soon as it gets rendered.
2015-04-28 00:27:43	Matip	it's weird, onResume is fine for code that needs the GUI ready in THAT activity

I'm going to check if pdf.js supports jumping into a precise position in the document.
2015-04-28 11:49:43	reversiblean	danijoo: gwrapper downloads gradle-1.12-all.zip which I think is quite old. Is that okay? the download url is specified in the /gradle/wrapper/gradle.properties

2015-04-28 11:54:02	mkdk	noahmg123, I think if there's this kind of pattern you should be able to do it automatically given the right tools.

2015-04-28 12:44:40	mkdk	noahmg123, it depends on the protection method you choose. If you go with an encrypted file and use the standard Android Crypto API, it's the same as reading any other file, you only have to set the key before you start reading the stream. The CipherInputStream will try to decrypt the data using that key before returning the data from the read() method. API: http://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/CipherInputStream.html

2015-04-28 12:48:51	mkdk	noahmg123, I'm not very familar with the access protocols in the SDK, but using the standard file:// most likely won't work. You'd have to use HTTP instead in order to be able to respond to the HTTP requests made by the pdf.js/WebView. Have a look at this solution which proposes reading the file and sending the binary data directly to the pdf.js. This would also make it very easy to implement the protection we talked about previously.

2015-04-28 13:47:15	icedp	actually salad if as lettuce can hard to digest. if you really had starving hard lasserix_ drink a bit of milk (assuming you tolerate lactose of course) or water with sugar. if it was not really hard, then just eat not much)
2015-04-28 13:47:49	g00s	mkdk mostly 2 reasons. one, rice being a water crop soaks up ambient pollutants. since pollutants are ubiquitous you are likely getting nasty things; for example in the US much rice is grown in former cotten areas which is contaminated with lead, so the rice is contaminated with lead
2015-04-28 13:48:08	danijoo	mkdk, are you sure? about 70% of humanity cant even consume milk.
2015-04-28 13:48:11	lasserix_	its more along the lines of like you've been backpacking for three weeks,you just got back into town and need that "meal" instead of the freeze dried strew you've been surviving on
2015-04-28 13:48:37	lasserix_	but def milk has been a big help: you can also go like almond or whatever if you are lactose interolarent
2015-04-28 13:48:38	yiati	mkdk: Food that is fantastic for survival tends to be terrible in large quantities which is what we mostly consume in the modern agricultural world
2015-04-28 13:49:15	g00s	from an insulin perspective, its not great eaither unless you get long grains, like long grain brown basmati or something. they dont have complete proteins, but you can increase their nutritional value letting them soak in water for a while to allow germination

And people before did the same as well. It's only now we are figuring out it's bad for us, but in here Europe it still has mainly possitive image in respect to overal health.

2015-04-28 15:42:48	mkdk	lasserix, yes, that is the expected behaviour. You cannot open a file that is locked. You have to catch the exception and use a loop or a callback to monitor the lock on the file. Once it's released, you'll be able to open it. Perhaps a better approach would be to synchronize the BufferStream instead and write the file at once.

2015-04-28 15:54:37	danijoo	yeah well I think you dont need that Analytics receiver if you only publish on google play
2015-04-28 15:54:40	mkdk	lasserix, also you might want to consider using more granual Lock mechanism than synchronized-block : http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/concurrent/locks/Lock.html -- Also note that the BufferedOutputStream provides synchronized versions of the write/flush/close methods : http://developer.android.com/reference/java/io/BufferedOutputStream.html

2015-04-28 16:45:10	danijoo	its basically your server contacting google server -> google server sending the message to the device if its online -> broadcastreceiver on the devices get called and does your stuff
2015-04-28 16:45:39	epinky	danijoo: and that messaging is free?
2015-04-28 16:45:42	danijoo	what is SNS?
2015-04-28 16:45:44	danijoo	epinky, yes
2015-04-28 16:45:52	epinky	danijoo: Amazon SNS
2015-04-28 16:46:29	danijoo	epinky, well. there are other services like GCM. I dont know Amazon SNS but maybe its one of those
2015-04-28 16:46:53	Mavrik	Most of them delegate delivery to GCM tho
2015-04-28 16:47:00	danijoo	push notifications are not built into android. they rely on libraries like GCM
2015-04-28 16:47:20	danijoo	well. one cound consider GCM as build in though ;)

2015-05-10 19:01:03	shmooz	maybe it's the emulator
2015-05-10 19:01:19	groxx	it's possible the parent view is doing something weird with layout that's messing it up :S  it's not quite "good" code, though it works reasonably well compared to others I've tried.
2015-05-10 19:01:59	groxx	eh, I don't think I've ever had layout differences with the emulator.  and this is 100% unaccelerated, so there shouldn't be any GPU glitches / etc.
2015-05-10 19:02:45	shmooz	ok, well it works for me, so it's gotta be something fixable for you

2015-05-10 20:05:02	JakeWharton	Tests and stuff will follow, but hopefully that shows enough of what I was talking about.
2015-05-10 20:05:12	g00s	groxx did you use a library for that ? i saw one the other day that did this
2015-05-10 20:05:29	g00s	but it did a bunch of other stuff too
2015-05-10 20:05:34	groxx	g00s: yeah: https://github.com/daimajia/AndroidSwipeLayout
2015-05-10 20:05:57	g00s	yeah i did see that one too
2015-05-10 20:06:06	groxx	it's pretty reasonable.  there are a couple oddities and a couple probably-bugs, but so far MUCH more reliable than others I've tried.
2015-05-10 20:06:12	groxx	which is not all that many, but yeah

2015-05-10 20:08:16	joshkovach	JakeWharton: cool, I think that makes sense. AppContainer is for the debug drawer, right?
2015-05-10 20:08:16	g00s	"The standards body for the microelectronics industry has found that Solid State Drives (SSD) can start to lose their data and become corrupted if they are left without power for as little as a week. "

I'm trying out a technique demoed by chiuki using Dagger 2, but I'm not really sure why my version doesn't work. Any thoughts why my test component doesn't get generated by the compiler? chiuki's demo: https://github.com/chiuki/android-test-demo/blob/master/app/src/androidTest/java/com/sqisland/android/test_demo/M

2015-05-10 22:26:12	JakeWharton	the problem is/was that a module can only publish a single artifact for consumption by other modules
2015-05-10 22:26:18	surf2b1	I'm asking if BuildConfig.DEBUG is always true in debug builds and always false on production builds when the lib is a dependency in another app.
2015-05-10 22:26:35	JakeWharton	no
2015-05-10 22:26:54	JakeWharton	see previous message as to why
2015-05-10 22:26:59	surf2b1	So, getting the package-name and checking BuildConfig class for that package is the way to go?

2015-05-10 22:55:30	JakeWharton	your activity will be recreated when the user rotates the device
2015-05-10 22:55:39	JakeWharton	this allows a new layout to be inflated
2015-05-10 22:55:54	JakeWharton	for example, you can have layout/main.xml and layout-land/main.xml
2015-05-10 22:56:08	>	napster_ has joined #android-dev
2015-05-10 22:56:11	JakeWharton	the former is the "default" so-to-speak, and the latter would only be used when the device was in landscape orientation

2015-05-11 01:17:01	g00s	yeah i'm kinda worried about that ... I tried running AS with Oracle 1.8 JVM, and the fonts were terrible. i had to revert back to Java 6, or it would have been headaches

2015-05-11 01:17:51	g00s	Oracle never implemented subpixel font AA in their JVM with Swing. I guess JavaFX has it

2015-05-11 01:26:35	g00s	t2mkn so the apple jvms use Quartz for their font rendering - oracle, no idea
2015-05-11 01:26:45	g00s	but its not Quartz, so thats why it doesn't look the same
2015-05-11 01:27:13	g00s	if you have a "retina" display, maybe your DPI is high enough you won't notice it
2015-05-11 01:27:30	g00s	but Oracle basically does greyscale AA which sucks

2015-05-19 12:56:56	Mavrik	tjbiddle, surfaceview is not a view as others and does NOT have a drawing cache
2015-05-19 12:57:16	Mavrik	it's just a proxy for a GPU allocated surface and most rendering stuff will not work on it
2015-05-19 12:57:36	IrishGringo	I want to get a new development phone... replace my samsung Gal 3...   And I want it to work on CDMA, verizon...  any sugestions on what to get?  what not to get?
2015-05-19 12:58:03	tjbiddle	Mavrik: Well that explains the constant black image. Hm, well it's definitely having things render on it. I should state it's a GL2SurfaceView - not sure if different
2015-05-19 12:58:34	>	aspire has joined #android-dev
2015-05-19 12:58:34	tjbiddle	Yeah - looks like SurfaceView and GLSurfaceView are different. Does that change anything?
2015-05-19 12:58:44	g00s	IrishGringo lol, you are still asking that :D
2015-05-19 12:59:02	Mavrik	tjbiddle, a bit.

2015-05-19 13:00:05	tjbiddle	Mavrik: Hm. So is there any way to get the image data from it?
2015-05-19 13:00:07	groxx	yeah, all the recent motorolas are quite good. looks like only the X has cdma though.
2015-05-19 13:00:18	Mavrik	Nexus 6
2015-05-19 13:00:23	TacticalJoke	If I were to buy a new device, my primary concern would be whether it's a good day-to-day device.
2015-05-19 13:00:40	groxx	Mavrik: arguably that's a nexus device :)
2015-05-19 13:00:43	TacticalJoke	App development would be secondary.  :D
2015-05-19 13:00:50	Mavrik	groxx, not really
2015-05-19 13:00:59	IrishGringo	I am mostly an iPHONE developer, and I have some versizon interests... so for political interests, I need to stick with versizon
2015-05-19 13:01:10	Mavrik	groxx, as soon as you want to root it to get better profiling stats, or wireless adb or some other useful tools it gets really fun
2015-05-19 13:01:13	tjbiddle	Mavrik: Actually I don't think that's entirely true. Because if I take the bitmap that getDrawingCache gives me, and I compress it to a PNG I won't get a black image - and instead will get something that looks corrupted; but I'll see a bit of what should be there (Like a small tiled version scrolling across of what it should be)
2015-05-19 13:01:29	Mavrik	tjbiddle, I'm not sure what's not clear
2015-05-19 13:01:41	Mavrik	you can't frigging get content of a hardware screen surface buffer via drawing cache
2015-05-19 13:01:47	groxx	Mavrik: by "fun" you mean "not easy", or "you can do a lot of fun things"?  I've had zero problems with wireless adb
2015-05-19 13:01:58	Mavrik	because those views DO NOT use a rendering pipeline that goes past the drawing cache
2015-05-19 13:02:16	g00s	IrishGringo i have some VZ interests too - interested in never using them again XD

2015-05-19 13:03:10	Mavrik	basic workings of machine RAM.
2015-05-19 13:03:21	IrishGringo	g00s: never again... any reason why?      I was having trouble with a verizon tablet one time...  kept returning to non debug mode.
2015-05-19 13:03:40	g00s	IrishGringo i terminated my contract after 2 years and they kept billing me
2015-05-19 13:03:56	g00s	they just fucking suck!
2015-05-19 13:04:03	Mavrik	Funnest experience with Verizon phones was when one refused to power on without calling home to VZW
2015-05-19 13:04:09	Mavrik	and the nearest CDMA network was 4000km away

2015-05-19 15:18:37	colintheshots	What’s the best practice for passing back multiple values from RxJava + Retrofit? Let’s say I want to save the query parameters for later down the chain. It seems insane to create a custom tuple for each step.
2015-05-19 15:19:03	groxx	Pair<Pair<W,X>,Pair<Y,Z>> !

2015-05-19 15:19:48	groxx	tbh I just make custom tuples.  it's The Java Way™.
2015-05-19 15:20:11	pfn	groxx, or just use a language that has tuples to begin with  :p
2015-05-19 15:20:14	groxx	more readable than Pair's ".first" and ".second", or the equivalent of a generic tuple / etc.
2015-05-19 15:20:58	icedp	why not pojo then
2015-05-19 15:21:00	groxx	doesn't fix the readability problem.  easy-to-create value-type-like Struct-things do help to have, but in Java that's just an every-field-is-final Class.
2015-05-19 15:21:51	pfn	g00s, https://gist.github.com/pfn/b25e35ccb62389f7bff8 reasonable enough...
2015-05-19 15:21:57	colintheshots	I’m fine with the custom tuple if it’s only one step, but in a long chain it starts to get unreadable.

2015-05-19 16:34:52	lasserix	groxx i have a listview with three adapters depending on toolbar click, and in one of those, if there are matching (text search) i need to show the header
2015-05-19 16:34:59	lasserix	then and only hten
2015-05-19 16:35:45	groxx	multiple view types isn't too hard, and you can just hide / remove the header row when it's not needed
2015-05-19 16:35:48	canvs2321-	is the header part of the data?
2015-05-19 16:36:01	canvs2321-	if so just use the getViewType or whatever it is called
2015-05-19 16:36:14	lasserix	no
2015-05-19 16:36:21	TacticalJoke	Yeah, you can just set a flag in the data source for the ListView, and then call notifyDataSetChanged and have the adapter show/hide the header as appropriate.
2015-05-19 16:36:23	canvs2321-	if not, then just put a view about your list

2015-05-19 17:18:07	Mavrik	He's talking about a hacky library which hacks his bytecode from Java 8 source to Java 6 bytecode and then kicks him the nuts.
2015-05-19 17:18:08	g00s	Mavrik so in Java8, is this true or not : obj::method != obj::method
2015-05-19 17:18:17	Mavrik	g00s, he doesn't have Java 8
2015-05-19 17:18:20	Mavrik	he has retrolambda

2015-05-19 17:28:13	Mavrik	Yeah, stuff like this is why we haven't adopted Retrolambda on the bigger commercial projects yet.
2015-05-19 17:28:14	akk	Ha! Just found the solution: rebooting.
2015-05-19 17:28:22	TacticalJoke	And also "The method reference Person::compareByAge is semantically the same as the lambda expression (a, b) -> Person.compareByAge(a, b)".

2015-05-19 17:28:29	Mavrik	Debugging implementation bugs is painful :/
2015-05-19 17:28:38	akk	It occurred to me that the fat filesystem on that SD card didn't have any file ownership built in,
2015-05-19 17:28:54	akk	so the root ownership must have been something KitKat was generating.
2015-05-19 17:28:57	TacticalJoke	I don't think a method reference could qualify as a lambda expression.

2015-05-19 17:29:10	Mavrik	akk, ahh, yeah, that makes sense.
2015-05-19 17:29:11	akk	And if I rebooted, it might make the ownership right based on the directory name.
2015-05-19 17:29:14	styler2go	the problem is, i can't get the necessary data to load the image in the CardViewHolder, and on the onBindViewHolder i can't access the View
2015-05-19 17:29:19	TacticalJoke	I think, by usual definitions, all lambda expressions are anonymous/unnamed/whatever.
2015-05-19 17:29:21	akk	Which apparently it did. *whew*
2015-05-19 17:29:24	Mavrik	TacticalJoke, IIRC even on J8 JVM, the method references are just lambdas

2015-05-19 17:30:16	groxx	styler2go: another problem: the viewholder will be used for multiple positions, as you scroll.  you may be writing position 5's image into position 23, while 23 is loading..
2015-05-19 17:30:45	styler2go	so how could i possibly do that?
2015-05-19 17:30:46	lasserix	styler2go: also putting your lazy holder in new is wrong, you want it in bind
2015-05-19 17:30:52	<	Boscop ha salido (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2015-05-19 17:31:05	lasserix	then when you bind, cancel any pending UI callbacks (still route it to your cache)
2015-05-19 17:31:17	lasserix	and start another task to retreive (check cache, if null then source it)
2015-05-19 17:31:24	groxx	styler2go: generally, I'd say "just find views in the constructor" + have a method to start loading, which you call in onBindViewHolder, and when you call it, also cancel the old one.
2015-05-19 17:31:29	styler2go	lasserix: chache what?
2015-05-19 17:31:39	lasserix	the bitmap or whatever returns from your async task
2015-05-19 17:31:45	lasserix	because for instance, if they start scrolling
2015-05-19 17:31:47	styler2go	i have that function already
2015-05-19 17:31:51	lasserix	you will have a hundred instances fire off
2015-05-19 17:31:56	styler2go	see line 66
2015-05-19 17:31:57	lasserix	yeah so in bindview cancel any task
2015-05-19 17:31:59	lasserix	start a new one
2015-05-19 17:32:00	groxx	styler2go: alternatively, some libraries like Picasso will do that "view is getting reused" logic for you, and Picasso also has an in-memory cache so the next time you view it will be quick.

2015-05-19 17:52:01	TacticalJoke	groxx:  I'd avoid them entirely.  I'd just put the attribute values in my custom View[Group] code.

2015-05-19 18:34:03	TacticalJoke	What is bootstrap?
2015-05-19 18:35:09	>	liftedbronco has joined #android-dev
2015-05-19 18:35:19	_genuser_	it's a UI framework by twitter. help you put together a decent UI quite fast.
2015-05-19 18:35:32	_genuser_	the UI is on par with all the "shmancy" websites you see out there today.
2015-05-19 18:35:44	TacticalJoke	Ah.

2015-05-19 18:36:41	_genuser_	basically, I know html/css. I'm comfortable sitting there and using documentation to have a html5/css2/3 website but hooking up all teh css myself would take forever. And the color matching, argh.
2015-05-19 18:36:58	_genuser_	with bootstrap, you just use the existing css classes. And if you want change, just get a different theme.
2015-05-19 18:37:02	surf2b1	_genuser_: why use a webview for your app?
2015-05-19 18:38:08	_genuser_	surf2b1: it's going to be a proper web interface.

2015-05-19 19:37:31	g00s	CedricBeust rxjava question; i am "merging" 2 observables: (1) PublishSubject<T1> that never completes and (2) another PublishSubject<T2> which are parser errors. I'd like the result to be the first of whichever emits first. Now #2 is emitting T2s which represent errors, not onErrors itself. So would you map those to Notification<Kind.Error> ?

2015-05-19 19:38:20	g00s	the result of the merge should have normal rxjava semantics; either a result or onError
2015-05-19 19:38:21	@CedricBeust	g00s: combineLatest?
2015-05-19 19:38:35	g00s	CedricBeust combineLatest requires both things to have emitted
2015-05-19 19:39:14	g00s	so if there are no emissions from #2, because there are no parser errors, the combineLatest(1,2) would be empty

2015-05-19 19:40:29	g00s	i guess the main thing is that i'm wrapping a legacy API with callbacks for results, and one for errors
2015-05-19 19:40:56	g00s	so i have to get those errors into the observables
2015-05-19 19:41:06	g00s	not sure if i should manually create Notifications myself
2015-05-19 19:41:10	aspire	http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html just a quick question about this tutorial - how does the service send messages to the app?

2015-05-25 11:33:51	canvs2321	i think it drops em, so removing 0 makes 1 0 doesn't it? it may not

2015-05-26 09:36:05	ThatAmine	hello all!
2015-05-26 09:37:42	ThatAmine	I am wondering what is the common architecture to bind a running website and another mobile app, I have already setup a Resrful api service but have issues with authentication

2015-05-26 09:38:25	ThatAmine	the website is under Ruby on Rails and the app is in Android SDK
2015-05-26 09:38:30	tx	Hi guys, I have an app that runs for pretty much ever (in a kiosk sort of setup)
2015-05-26 09:38:38	tx	after a while the animations and overall UI start to slow down.

2015-05-26 09:42:15	paulo_	I had 9k ad impressions, and I only made $1.45
2015-05-26 09:42:32	paulo_	people, this is how difficult it is to make money using android apps.

2015-05-26 09:48:23	tx	ok
2015-05-26 09:48:40	tx	the slow downs seem to occur when wifi operations are going on in the background
2015-05-26 09:48:50	tx	(Android WifiHW tagged debug output)
2015-05-26 09:50:46	dragorn	tx, gc only works to a certain extent.  If you do something that leaves orphaned references to things, you're going to leak memory over time for sure.  Slowdown doesn't necessarily sound like memory leaking, though - sure you're not constantly registering new events and not clearing out the old ones, or something like that?
2015-05-26 09:51:07	tx	dragorn:  It seems system related now. The UI outside of the app is slow too.
2015-05-26 09:51:24	tx	I can see WiFi events in the debugging log and the UI in general, not just the app

2015-05-26 09:51:29	tx	seem very choppy and slow.

2015-05-26 09:51:35	tx	I'll try disabling wifi.
2015-05-26 09:51:38	dragorn	wifi events dont' mean anything
2015-05-26 09:51:41	dragorn	wifi constantly changes states
2015-05-26 09:51:59	tx	Well, they just happen to coincide with stuttering.
2015-05-26 09:52:03	dragorn	especially if there's multiple APs nearby, powersaving is active, etc.  wifi is very chatty.
2015-05-26 09:52:13	gottaGO	paulo_, have you tried any other ad service?
2015-05-26 09:52:13	tx	oh look at that
2015-05-26 09:52:19	tx	WiFi is off, tablet is fast. :P
2015-05-26 09:52:36	paulo_	gottaGO: not yet. I'm only 2 weeks in.
2015-05-26 09:52:42	paulo_	I'm gonna give it more time.
2015-05-26 09:52:42	tx	It could be a voltage issue. The display on this thing has heaps of ghosting.

2015-05-26 10:05:08	shekibobo	does android stub out the app's R class in unit tests? i.e. can I test a POJO that returns R.color.status_warning without the system blowing up at me?
2015-05-26 10:05:20	shekibobo	not on a computer i can test it on right now
